Attendance: Not only is Marci steadfastly reliable, but she has gone above and beyond this semester to dedicate hours to preparing and overseeing events outside her normal work time. She has also come in on short notice when asked.
Accountability: Marci has been staying on top of a number of responsibilities and providing regular updates. She regularly shows herself to be invested in maintaining the program space and equipment to a high standard.
Teamwork: One area in which Marci has really shone this year has been in helping to coordinate the various doings of our program, from teaching to special events. She has served as office liaison with the Triota Honor Society, ensuring that we are better able to support their work and that they are willing and able to help the WGS program as needed.
Initiative: In her mid-year evaluation, we expressed hope that Marci would continue to grow in this area. We have not been disappointed. Partly thanks to her regular presence in the office, we have been able to keep Marci "in the loop" and invested in ways that have allowed her to take charge of projects while still (we hope!) feeling supported. She is developing good habits of asking questions up front and working to understand the whole picture so that she can continue on her own effectively.
Respect:  
Learning: Marci has gained a great deal of practical knowledge this year about how our program works, and has been increasingly active in developing ways to help it work better. She has also had ample opportunity to develop a better understanding of how to deal with human foibles. Marci harbors a burning desire to fix the problems of the world, and I do hope she appreciates how the organizational and people skills she is developing in this position will help her in this endeavor.
Job Specific: This is an awkward category to evaluate, since I believe we still do not have up-to-date job descriptions on file with the Labor office, but both of our primary labor students have been helping us to develop new descriptions. Thus Marci is well-acquainted with the details of her soon-to-be-revised job description, and she has been punctilious in carrying out her duties.

Attendance: Eny is generally punctual in reporting to work, but there have been several days when she has not showed up or notified me of an absence. Time management issues need to be solved so that sleep does not interfere with academic and labor commitments.  
Accountability: Eny is a fast worker, but often skips the step of building in time to look over work to catch errors. It is a good practice to build in a review step before saying an assignment is complete. 
Teamwork: Eny is a good team player in this office, willing to share her knowledge of technology with others. Proofing the work she does before sharing it with the person who assigned the task needs to be developed more. 
Initiative: Eny works quickly on tasks assigned to her, and works well with little supervision, but needs to slow down and build in time to review the work to check for errors. The goal is to turn in the best possible work, not for the supervisor to have to spend time correcting errors. 
Respect: Eny is friendly and respectful to all who she encounters in this office. She uses correct etiquette when answering the phones and greeting people who enter the office for meetings. Her demeanor is professional and respectful, appropriate for an administrative office.   
Learning: Eny has participated in learning technology short-cuts and sharing those with the rest of the office. She has made connections between gaining new office skills and how they help with her academic work.
Job Specific: Eny has two areas that can be developed during the next academic year. 1. Slow down and make sure to check your work before saying it is complete and sending it to your supervisor. 2. Continue to refine your time management skills so that work hours do not suffer,and remember to communicate with the office concerning absences.

Attendance: This has been a problem area this semester.  On many occasions Bre has waited until the last minute to let me know when she needs to leave for basketball or track.  In the past few weeks she has done a better job.  She did explain her coach kept changing the time of departure the last few weeks.
Accountability: If it is something she is interested in she does very well at completing the tasks in a timely manner.  Some of the tasks given to her that she is unfamiliar with, she does a really good job researching how to do things.  For example, InDesign projects.
Teamwork: Works great with others and enjoys working on projects with other team members. 
Initiative: This has been a difficult area if tasks are not automatically assigned when she first comes in.  Bre will not be returning to OAS due to her demanding schedule.  Once she realized she would be taking another position in a different area in the fall, she really lost focus at work and taking some initiative at times. 
Respect: Respectful and polite to visitors, students, coworkers, and professional staff members.
Learning: At the beginning of the semester, Bre showed a great willingness to jump in and do what she was asked when I've given her tasks, so this was greatly appreciated. I've noticed a changed when she realized she was not returning to OAS.  In the future, I would encourage her to stay focused on the job and assignments even if a change in labor position is happening in the future.
Job Specific: Bre fulfills basic labor requirements. Sometimes may find it difficult with new tasks i.e. performance checks but works hard at understanding it.  Very capable of doing extremely well on the job.

Accountability: This semester I have given Iliana the sole responsibility to help train the new AVL coworker, and to begin the designing, implementation, and weaving of the broomcorn table runner prototypes.  I can count on Iliana to work out the kinks that allows the production weaver to take over without a problem.

Initiative: This semester, I have watched Iliana take on the designer role.  She has been pushed into a new arena that has developed her color sense and individuality when weaving the new broomcorn table runners.
Respect: Iliana always has a crowd around her loom.  She is able to draw her observers in with her knowledge and verbal ability to explain a complex craft.
Learning: Iliana has been learning this semester on how to produce one of a kind items at a production pace.  Designing a warp that will work with various wefts, eliminate any production time issues, and weave a product that has sellable qualities showcases her knowledge of the craft.

Attendance: Sarah has great attendance.  She realizes that her attendance is the paramount to getting the products to the warehouse.
Accountability: Sarah has gained a huge amount of knowledge that has allowed her to be a team leader in sectional warping the 12 epi rugs or placemats.   
Teamwork: This semester, Sarah has been a key figure in the training of the new students on warping the rugs and placemats.  Her consistent format has been so helpful in allowing the students to retain the process.
Initiative: I have given Sarah the task of using odd, small batches of rags to use up in the Sarah’s Garden Rag rug series.  She has the ability to keep track and organize the rag to produce a visually pleasing rug. Understanding the “why” of excess inventory, gives Sarah a reason to stay on top of this task too.   
Respect: Sarah is a communication major and her ability to tell the Berea story as well as the weaving processes is a great combination. 
Learning: This semester, Sarah has been working on maintaining the Sarah’s Garden series, Fiesta placemats, training new students on warping procedures and has begun designing the new rag placemat, and coordinating with me on the Rep Weave Game mat.
Job Specific: I believe, Sarah has really excelled in this department in her time at Berea College. She has a great color sense and enjoys making a wonderful product.  I have nominated her for the Mary Abrams Award again this year for all her contributions to making our rag rugs and placemats a seller.

Attendance: Zachary had a number of unexcused absences, in which he did not notify me prior to his shift. Had I done a better job of keeping track of them he would've easily had his three and been released from the position.
Accountability: I had to ask Zachary multiple times to get a task done if it was not on his "regular" list. One of these tasks that I asked for three weeks in a row was never completed.
Teamwork: Zachary missed work more more than he should've. He also didn't seem to understand how to prioritize what needed to be done when his hours went down due to an injury. He did not communicate well with me in terms of adjusting his hours and duties- initially he said he had been released and it took multiple times of telling him he needed to talk to the labor office to finally get him to do so.
Initiative: Zachary started off the term doing very well here, but he dro pped off considerably and by the end he was simply not doing tasks that required any bit of effort.
Respect: Zachary never dealt with me in a professional manner. He would send e-mails without any greeting or signature. He would text last-minute and miss work hours for things that shouldn't have overlapped with work hours. He interrupted me in a meeting to tell me that he was doing his hours a day early, which meant I couldn't meet him about this labor evaluation.
Learning: This one Zachary really started the term off well. Our building monitor was injured, and he stepped up to the plate and trained other students on how to do building duty. But this dro pped off quite rapidly as the term progressed. By spring break he was back to doing the bare minimum (and that progressed into doing less than the bare minimum by the end of the term).
Job Specific: As stated previously he missed work and his performance when he was at work dro pped off throughout the term.

Initiative: I think Holden is a natural self-starter.  He has the ideas, the talents, and the intelligence. I'm looking forward to working with him again to help bring more of the ideas to "market."

40875: I felt as though a couple of these scores were wrong and discussed them with both Becky and Denessa. While the attendance section is correct. The area of teamwork is not true. If you ask anyone who knows me they would tell you that encouraging others is a strong point of mine. In fact, i spent much time encouraging my co workers even though it may have went unnoticed. However, i did feel as though teamwork in the office had decreased and eventually i became fed up with working on a team that was not willing to work with me. Further, i was always going the extra mile when i was at work and i feel as though that was not always seen. I do not agree with the fact that i do not manage time well or stay on task. In fact i am the person in the office that is always trying to find more work to do.

Attendance: Casey is generally punctual and arrives on time for work as scheduled.

Teamwork: I think Casey is still figuring out his place in the studio. Sometimes he appears to enjoy collaboration, while other times not. I do see good relationships occurring between Casey and other students. Often Casey will mentor beginning students in making ceramic work. 
Initiative: When directed, Casey will complete assignments consistently. I would like to see him take more initiative with studio management and take more ownership of the studio processes.
Respect: Casey generally exhibits professional conduct in the workplace. 
Learning: Casey shows obvious interest in learning new skills and obviously understands the value of his job. I see an enjoyment with sharing knowledge. I consider this one of Casey's strong points.

He also is capable of producing very strong work, although this is occasionally spotty in quality. We will work on craft and studio responsibility in the upcoming year.

Attendance: Jessica has done much better this semester in maintain her schedule.
Accountability: Jessica has been a big help in putting on the scarf warps, getting them tied up and weaving them.
Teamwork: Jessica has been able to help more in teams, since she is versatile in several procedures.  She helps with sectional warping, beaming warps, and then is able to weave on various products (placemats, love knot, and waffle scarf designs).
Initiative: Jessica is a person who sees the “big” picture.  She sees how each part enhances or detracts the final outcome.  With this ability she can interject a new way or change the process so that the outcome is more productive or cohesive. 
Respect: Jessica has improved her communication skills greatly this semester in relaying what procedures needed to be attended to, speaking with the tourist, and in showcasing how to convey her confidence.
Learning: This semester Jessica took on the production of the 2016 Love Knot scarf.  She had been weaving a heavier scarf yarn, but the love knot pushed her ability into a finer woven product.  She has been very successful at this weave, maintaining the consistent epi’s as well as maintaining  her edges.  Great Job!
Job Specific: Overall Jessica has embraced the production work scene in weaving.  She thrives on having numerous hands on tasks to complete.  I am hoping that many of the detail oriented skills learned in this department will carry over to her next job in the fall semester.

Attendance: Jasmine rarely misses or reschedules work.  She is extremely reliable, and punctual. 
Accountability: Jasmine does all assigned tasks and then some.  The "self-cleaning" elevator is actually Jasmine seeing something that needs to be done and doing it!
Teamwork: Since Jasmine has high attendance and reliability she contributes to the team effort of keeping our dorms clean.  She also is flexible and willing to change her tasks when unexpected needs present themselves. 
Initiative: As I mentioned before she does tasks that she is not asked to do because she sees they need to be done. She is willing to change what she is assigned to support the overall goal of our Residential Team.  Jasmine is a super star!
Respect: Jasmine is very respectful of others whether it be supervisors, co-workers or residents.  She does not engage in conflict and is understanding of differing points of view. 
Learning: Jasmine has willingly trained underclassmen in the expectation of their job.  She understands the importance of our job even when residents do not appreciate her work.  
Job Specific: Jasmine as I said before is very conscious of the overall goals of the Residential Cleaning Team and gets the job done.  When things are left undone and she notices she does it herself.  The most important thing for an FA is to be at work and Jasmine is always there.

Attendance: As Kyle was assigned a sports team to work with this semester, he was kept very busy. As always he was very punctual, even with schedule changes, no matter what the reason.  He rarely asks for time off but when he does he continues to ask well in advance.  As he was given a larger contract obligation he had no issue completing almost all of his labor contract.
Accountability: Kyle is very dependable when it comes to completing assigned tasks.  We don't ever have to worry about him taking care of our equipment, as he always takes care of it as if it were his own.
Teamwork: When working with Kyle, objectives seem to be completed very smoothly.  He is extremely easy to work with, as he has a very polite and laid back demeanor.  He seems to never have any friction with any students or other staff members.  At times though Kyle may put more work on his back instead of being able to ask for help.
Initiative: As he is a busy individual it is rare that jobs need to be assigned to Kyle.  He is always looking to complete tasks before someone even asks.  He is a great when it comes to adjusting with poise and completing new tasks as they present themselves.
Respect: Respect is clearly a high priority for Kyle.  He is one student that we never have to worry much, if at all, about his interactions with staff and students.  He does a very good when dealing with individuals with differing view points and does his best to see both sides. 
Learning: Despite getting less time in the ATR due to his assigned sport, he puts forth a good effort to put himself in a situation to learn.  If he does have time to spend with us he almost always positions himself in a way to absorb any information that we are giving student athletes.  He is also very good at asking questions to fill in any gaps that may have developed when he is trying to understand a topic.
Job Specific: As this was Kyle's second semester working within the ATR he has continued to grow as one of our workers. He did a very good job taking on a very demanding sport assignment and never complained.  He will be expected to continue to grow into one of our students that will set examples for underclassmen.

Attendance: Without her volleyball obligation this semester, Destiney completed her labor contract without any issues.  She did a fantastic job working with the track teams this semester.  She was scheduled to share track team coverage with another student worker this semester but often times found herself carrying the load but never complained.  
Accountability: Down the stretch this semester Destiney's obligations grew as she was working with the track team as well as participating in spring volleyball practice.  She did a great job of managing her time and making sure she was able to put forth good effort towards both.
Teamwork: With having to help take care of two of our largest sports teams, Destiney improved on her teamwork skills tremendously this semester.  She did get some help midway through track season, when she did, it was up to her and the other student to come up with a schedule.  They worked very well together in coming up with a schedule that would suit both parties. The track coach often praised her on the job she did for them. 
Initiative: Destiney is rounding out her first full year in the ATR, and has came a long ways from where she was initially.  As she has had less on her plate this semester she made a greater effort on completing tasks given to her.  Her initiative has drastically changed this semester as she has started to understand the routines and can complete daily tasks without any supervision.
Respect: Destiney has improved on becoming an active listener.  She is starting to learn how to incorporate her own injuries into conversations without taking away from the injuries she is helping with.  She has always been very polite and shows she is very interested in helping others, as she is always willing to go out of her way to help.
Learning: Destiney shows excitement when it comes to gaining knowledge.  When asking questions, she does so to set herself up to better understand concepts.  She has started building a very good foundation of knowledge to improve her work.
Job Specific: Destiney truly stepped up her abilities this semester.  She will be more challenged in the fall with having to balance school, work, and volleyball.  As she has more knowledge and confidence working in the ATR it is expected that her performance only gets better going into next year. The track coach was very pleased with the effort she gave to the team.

Attendance: Tyler has completed his contract obligation and then some this semester!  He even went as far as to make himself available for overnight trips with his assigned team.  Towards the end of the semester Tyler needed to spend more time with his academics due to his difficult course load.  At times he has had difficulty giving advance notice on days that he would need off.
Accountability: Tyler is a very task oriented person and when given a task he is always up for the challenge of completing any assigned task.  He always comes to work in a very professional attire and cares for any facility or tool as if it was his own.
Teamwork: Tyler has always been a reliable team member.  He knows how to take charge when necessary.  At times though he may get his boundaries blurred on what his role is within this work environment.  He occasionally would make decisions that he is not qualified nor has the knowledge to recommend.
Initiative: As this was Tyler's second semester with us, he was more in tune with routines of the Athletic Training room.  He did spend most of his semester working with his assigned sports team which constantly had changes to the schedule, which he was capable of adapting too.
Respect: Naturally Tyler shows his respect for others through his mannerisms.  He had many instances this semester where he had to deal with differing points of view and stayed neutral as well as he could.  At times, he can get a little comfortable with his co-workers blurring the line of playful joking and occasionally insulting others.
Learning: Continuing to gain knowledge is a large part of advancing in any profession.  Tyler was away caring for his assigned sports team the majority of the time, the times that he was in a learning environment his motivation to learn was less than expected.  He continues to keep a heavy course load which also demands a lot of his time, which may have made things a little overwhelming.
Job Specific: As Tyler was placed with the softball team this semester he was asked to go above and beyond what he was required to do in his first semester.  He rose to the occasion as the softball team seemingly enjoyed having him work with them.

Attendance: Caleb is very punctual with his schedule and always seems willing to help cover any open shifts.  He hardly ever misses work, but if he does he is very considerate with giving plenty of notice.
Accountability:  
Teamwork: Caleb is always willing to give a helping hand.  He shows up everyday with a positive attitude that makes him very easy to work with.  His teamwork shows in multiple ways, but you know he is always willing to help because no matter the day or time he always asks if he is needed for anything else before he leaves work.  This occurs even if it is his scheduled time to leave.
Initiative: As this semester went along we saw more assertiveness and leadership skills out of Caleb.  He did a fantastic job reaching out of his comfort zone with a few athletes this semester.  His personality may still be more reserved but he has definitely made a valiant effort in pushing his comfort limits. In pushing himself we have seen him become more confident with being a self-starter.
Respect: At no time has there ever been any question of Caleb's respect for others.  He takes the extra time needed to hear out what others need.   As Caleb is very quiet and reserved he tends to stay out of most conflicts, but if he ever finds himself within one he does a good job of being more of a mediator and trying to see both arguments.
Learning: After Caleb finished working with his assigned sport, he started working more hours within the ATR.  He really became a stronger member to our staff as he took on new responsibilities on helping with rehabilitation's and participating in daily activities.  He truly took on the challenge of stepping up his responsibility of learning, and succeeded.
Job Specific: Caleb did a fantastic job with his assigned sports team, as they are not always the most welcoming.  He then made a smooth switch into the ATR where he became a large asset in helping with daily routines.  He has completed his job in full this year, but more is expected from him as he goes into his senior year and will have the most experience on our student staff.

Attendance:  
Accountability: Has improved from first semester.  Is good about completing tasks and taking ownership of space to keep it functional and long lasting for years to come.
Teamwork: Has offered on numerous occasions to cover games so others could catch up on homework or to just have a weekend off.
Initiative: As a long standing student employee, he has a great grasp on tasks which need to be done and will get things done.
Respect: David became a father over Christmas break which has been a positive influence on how he responds to things now.  Is not as quick tempered.
Learning: David has stepped up this semester in doing more evaluations and working with other students through the process which has been beneficial to he and the other students.
Job Specific: David has grown into a more responsible and educated person which has been wonderful for our staff.

Attendance: Savannah has continued her great track record for work attendance yet again this semester. Savannah always is willing to help cover shifts when other students cannot.  As always she is very good about giving plenty of notice when she needs time off.
Accountability: Savannah is one who enjoys staying busy, so when given a task she completes it without any delay.  Frequently she asks to be given tasks even when we don't always have things for her to do.  She is always willing to help out and trys her best to make things run as smoothly as possible.
Teamwork: Savannah is a very selfless individuals, as she always does her best to make sure others get the help that they need.  She does so at all time, as there have been many times that she has just volunteered her time to help instead of being on the clock.  To our staff that shows that she is more concerned with working as a team to help others, than her own self gains.
Initiative: On most occasions she has completed tasks before we are able to even assign it.  This is partly due to her amount of experience working within the ATR, but most of her strong initiative is just from her natural personality.  When assigning tasks to her, there is never any worry on how well it will be completed or how long it will take.
Respect:  
Learning: As Savannah is the only student working for us that has taken both athletic training classes offered, she has gained more knowledge than most of her peers.  In gaining that knowledge she did a great job applying it practically.  She not only has learned practical skills within the classroom, but also has attained very strong critical thinking skills which will help her in many facets of life.
Job Specific: Savannah was a tremendous asset working with our staff this semester.  She had more time to spend helping in the ATR this semester as she did not have an assigned sports team to work with.  The majority of the time she was asked to help open the ATR, as she did she always made sure it was prepared so we could start treating athletes as soon as we walked in.  She will most definitely be missed :(

Attendance: As Tyler took on extra obligations this semester, it was challenging for him to complete his hours compared to the fall semester or years past.  We did have to push him to make sure he was catching up on his hours.
Accountability: When given specific tasks completed them easily but sometimes he found himself being distracted by individuals who pulled him away from the athletic training room which distracted from tasks at hand.
Teamwork: There where some struggles with him sharing track duties this semester which resulted in him only being able to cover 1 track meet. He often times found himself being pulled away on weekends for family events.
Initiative:  
Respect: He has always been wonderful in how he treats and interacts with everyone.  
Learning: Tyler enjoys learning which is evident by his going onto Physical Therapy school in the fall semester.  As this was his last semester he slipped a little in this area with trying to finish his degree requirements and traditional senioritis :)
Job Specific: We have enjoyed working with Tyler for the last 2 years and will very much miss his presence in the athletic training room.  He has been an asset to our staff and the student athletes.

Attendance: Elle consistently attends all meetings and work requirements. Elle also regularly spends time in the office and creat es opportunities to connect by her presence in the office. 
Accountability: Elle completes all assignments asks of her and works to support all workplace policies at CELTS. Her support of CELTS policies models to her First Year Bonners what is expected of them. 
Teamwork: Elle excels at creating a collaborative team and understanding her larger contribution to the CELTS office. Elle maintains her exemplary performance as an FYC while also working with Berea Buddies and going above and beyond in her individual meetings. Elle takes the time to know the First Year Bonners and ensures they feel seen, cared for, and respected. I cannot say enough about how Elle works to ensure that everyone feels welcome in our CELTS space. Elle also continues to work on implementing ways to take care of herself to better understand how her self-care impacts her work with others in the department. 
Initiative: Elle can function independently as a FYC. She continues to grow in establishing her "authority" as a FYC, yet seeks guidance when needed. 
Respect: Elle consistently demonstrates professional conduct in her work at CELTS. Elle is always receptive to feedback and respects not only her supervisors, but also her co-workers. Elle can continue to grow in her ability to give critical feedback to her First Year Bonners. 
Learning: Elle is always seeking to personally grow in her role as a FYC. She wants to better understand herself, particularly how she can model self-care behaviors for her team, while also providing care for those around her. Elle could work on finding ways to share her knowledge with the larger CELTS department and finding more voice and authority in the FYB trainings. 
Job Specific: Elle successfully meets all requirements of her job description. She goes above and beyond to ensure her team has what they need. Elle also has great energy and that is contagious when she steps up in trainings. Elle demonstrated responsibility and maturity during our Spring Break trip while also connecting deeply with the First Year Bonners. I know many students who are immensely thankful for Elle's presence in their lives.

Attendance: Lalou consistently places work as a top priority and is always at work when scheduled. If Lalou has to be late or needs to reschedule she always gives advance notice. Most times Lalou is early for any assigned work obligation. 
Accountability: Lalou always has things completed when asked. Lalou consistently supports the policies of CELTS and also mentors her First Year Bonners to do the same. Lalou is respectful of CELTS spaces, always cleans up, and ensures proper use of all CELTS materials. She even contributes to tasks that are not originally assigned to her. 
Teamwork: Lalou always puts the positive atmosphere of work at the forefront of her obligations. Lalou consistently thinks of others and how best to support them to improve their functioning for the betterment of themselves and the team. The First Year Bonners show a high level of respect for Lalou because she values each of them and what they bring to the team. In addition, Lalou is aware of her presence in a space and knows when to step up and step back to ensure everyone can contribute to the team environment. In addition, she utilizes her strengths of connection and leadership to contribute to the overall CELTS environment. 
Initiative: Lalou can complete all tasks assigned with minimal supervision. If it is a task Lalou is unfamiliar with she asks for instructions and then can move forward. Lalou also recognizes her strength for leadership development and the ability to establish connection and utilizes those to offer trainings to both CELTS staff and FYB's. Her trainings are well-received. 
Respect: Lalou is very respectful to all team members in CELTS. She listens to differing points of view and works to integrate the information into her worldview. Lalou is growing in her ability to give difficult feedback to her student staff. This is a natural development as it takes practice to better this skill. 
Learning: She shares her knowledge with others in various CELTS training and has established great mentorships with her student staff. She shares knowledge of resources on campus that can help her students experience greater success. She also works to reflect and learn alongside the first year Bonners. It was evident  on Spring Break that she was interested in her own personal development and shared her growth process during reflection. This type of processing is helpful as it models an openness for growth. Lalou is always willing to hear feedback on ways she can improve her performance and readily makes any changes asked of her. 
Job Specific: Overall Lalou exceeds her expectations for the First Year Coordinator Position. I feel lucky to be her supervisor and I know her students love and respect her presence in their lives. She has established close relationships with them that promote honesty and connection.

Attendance: Jessi is on time and ready to do her job anytime she is asked. She went above and beyond this semester to ensure another First Year Team also arrived at their school on time. 
Accountability: Jessi is highly accountable. She ensures all jobs are completed and really stepped up with the Spring Break trip. She helped with securing food for FYB's and also managing schedules during the Spring Break trip. I can always count on Jessi to have the answer to a question or at least know where to find the answer. She is going to make an excellent Senior intern next semester. 
Teamwork: She demonstrates that she is interested in the functioning of the team and works to ensure that individuals are working collaboratively to complete projects. Jessi works to give feedback to First Year Bonners when they are not supporting the collaborative nature of the job. I do think Jessi can continue to focus on how to give that feedback so all students can hear it and be receptive to it. 
Initiative: I never have to worry about Jessi completing a project. She is also willing to adjust to whatever circumstances arise. She was great on Spring Break in reminding the students to be adaptable and that we were there to serve others. She takes on a leadership role with the other FYC's and I often look to her if I need implementation of something quickly. 
Respect: Jessi is respectful of all CELTS staff. She helps other team members work through conflict and works to ensure FYB's have exposure to diverse training opportunities. 
Learning: She works hard to better understand her job and how she can relate it to her work, life, and grow in her roles. I think Jessi could work to find more ways to share her knowledge with the larger CELTS community, but does work to make sure she leads trainings on her areas of knowledge for FYBs.
Job Specific: Jessi successfully meets all requirements of an FYC. I know she will be a great mentor to students next year in her new role.

Job Specific: Braden is a marvelous box office manager - always aware of the needs of the office, while balancing those with the needs of the team.  He organizes all the activities well and in far enough advance to receive adequate preparation. His energy and professionalism are without equal.  He plans to pursue seeking employment in a theatre's box office, and I could not be more proud nor could I offer a higher recommendation.  A very wonderful ambassador for any theatre.

Attendance: As a Building Manager, Megi has served as a great role model regarding attendance. She is always punctual because she must be as the one in charge of the building in the absence of the faculty/staff
Accountability: Megi takes great care to maintain a clean and organized work environment. She has committed the library policies to heart and takes them all very seriously.
Teamwork: Megi is a team player, always concerned about offering support to both her supervisors and her peers alike. Megi’s peers respect her and trust her because she leads by example, holding herself to the highest of standards and treating her peers with a dignity and diplomacy that inspires those around her. 
Initiative: Megi never waits to be told to work. If I don't have a special project for her to work on, then she will ask if she may be of assistance in some other way. If I still don't have anything, then she busies herself cleaning or straightening. She is a true self-starter
Respect: Megi is so professional in her roles as Building Manager, Reference Associate, and Reference Consultant that people constantly comment on her respectful and professional conduct
Learning: Megi is a born teacher. Within the library, Megi has taught others through her work as a one-on-one Reference Consultant. She meets with students, by appointment, and uses active learning techniques to help them work through their individual issues with the research process. Through discussion shedetermines what they already know and what they need; through debate she helps students evaluate resources, defending the merits of one source over another; through discovery she helps them determine their research needs and the appropriate sources to meet them. She is a tenacious researcher and is equipped with a kind and patient demeanor, so she excels in this capacity. 
Job Specific: While I have been lucky enough to supervise some gifted and promising young people in the past, I can say with confidence that Megi is singularly the best student employee I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I have supervised dozens of students in my 5 years in this position and Megi stands out as unique among them because of her drive, leadership, and intellectual capacity. While it would be inappropriate for me to say as much out loud, I have come to consider her a junior colleague rather than a student worker.

Job Specific: Justice is an excellent Student Chaplain.  I look forward to working with her in a leadership position and watch as she continues to develop leadership skills.Justice is one of the student chaplains who truly lives out the goal and mission of a student chaplain. Justice is one of the most open minded people I have known. As a result, her programs have been inclusive in addressing spiritual wellness. Justice is always on time and responsible. Fully present at meetings, she makes wise and honest comments when asked for her opinions. One aspect that Justice should improve on, however, is making herself more available for her residents. From reading her comments on Tracy and my conversation with her, I was able to understand that she didn’t do lots of intentional contact hours this semester.

Attendance: Toward the end of the semester Olamide struggled with getting to meetings on time.  She is sometimes tired and distracted during meetings.  I understand that this is often due to the academic demands of her major.
Accountability: Again, due to the demands of her major, she sometimes does not get work completed on time.  But, she works hard and does complete the work.
Teamwork: She is a bright light in our team with much kindness and good humor.  I would encourage her to realize how much her team supports and needs her.
Initiative: She has clearly taken more initiative this year and has spoken out more in labor meetings.  I am very proud of the changes she has made.  She participates more, is engaged and beginning to find her voice.
Respect:  
Learning: She has really grown this year as a person and as a Student Chaplain.
Job Specific: I have seen much growth in Olamide this year and look forward to continued work with her next year.Olamide has made a lot of improvements since last year. She has really taken initiative to be proactive with her job.  I have seen her building connections with other students and becoming a mentor.  Only as of late have things been slipping a little (coming late to labor meeting, a little lack of communication on Starfish tables in food service).   Overall, Olamide has grown as a student chaplain and as a person. It has been a joy to work with her this year.

Learning: Esther has shown much growth and demonstrated a willingness  learn and apply what she learned to her life.  She read books and interacted with discussions on leadership and life skills.

She has done her job with dedication, commitment and grace.Esther has been a dependable worker this semester.  She always shows up for duty nights and makes connections with new people. Her motivation does seem to be lacking as compared to last year. She has done an overall good job of managing all the duties that she has signed up for this semester.

Initiative: Alex is dependable and consistently completes assignments without having to be reminded.
Respect: Shows respect for his residents and for his SC team members.
Learning: Alex spoke at Carter G. Woodson weekend and in a chapel service.  I appreciate the extra effort he put into these two events.  He has been good about interacting with books and ideas with which he may not necessarily agree.  I would encourage him to continue to push himself to interact with ideas and approaches which push against his comfort zones.
Job Specific: Alex has been an excellent 1st year Student Chaplain.We have heard a lot of good things about him from his residents and coworkers. I believe he should push himself outside of his comfort zone a little more and that he has potential to grow into a wonderful leader.

Annie is a very flexible and caring individual, however, for next year I would like to see her work on expanding out of her circle of friends and trying reaching out to w wider circle of people on campus.

Job Specific: Priscila is an excellent Student Chaplain and I look forward to seeing her develop her leadership skills next year.Passionate about service, Priscila has done a great job of making herself available to her residents and knows them at a personal level.

While she loves her job and always strives to do the best she can, she still has room to improve in certain areas.  I think for next year, she should work on building her confidence and independence when planning and executing programs.

Attendance: Sharpy is present and engaged in labor meetings.  I will encourage him to continue to work on setting personal boundaries and priorities.  His servant heart sometimes leads him to put other's needs over his own responsibilities.
Accountability: Manages his time well but can continue to work on scheduling and coordinating academic, labor and personal commitments.
Teamwork: Sharpy is a solid, supportive and and sensitive team member.  He works well with peers and supervisor.
Initiative: Especially in the residence hall, he takes initiative with his residents and with the care of the hall facilities.  Next year, I will encourage him to share his ideas regarding Student Chaplain involvement of campus.
Respect: Very good job with getting in hours and comments on time which is much appreciated.
Learning: Sharpy reads and discusses our books and makes effort to apply the concepts to his personal and work life.  He has been an excellent 1st year Student Chaplain and I look forward to him taking on a greater leadership role next year.
Job Specific: Sharpy is a very dedicated worker.  I have heard from his residents and his staff that he is their “go to” person. He cares for his residents and tries to connect with as many people as he can.  I think his biggest struggle is learning to tell people ‘no’.  He has put in several weeks of 20+ hours.  Also, his comments are sparse even after asking him a few times to be more detailed.  Sharpy always finds a way to be funny and is a joy to work alongside.

Her programs were very creative and aimed at being inclusive of all students while keeping spirituality as their big component. During my duty night visits, I was able to observe that Elshaday seeks to find out areas where she can improve up on to help her perform the best at her job.

Attendance: Maranda is punctual, responsible, and keeps me well informed of any changes in her plans.
Accountability: Maranda meets all the requirements of the job description except that she is not always consistent about filling out the weekly progress (work completed) reports.  She puts in whatever time and effort is necessary to complete her choir tasks, even extra time if that is necessary.
Teamwork: Maranda is collaborative, cheerful, and positive.  She works well with others, and shows patience and respect for choir members even when they are not responsible about appointments for fittings, checkout and return of choir materials.
Initiative: Maranda is very good about knowing what duties she needs to perform, and anticipating problems and situations.
Respect: Maranda works exceptionally well with me, with her co-workers, and with students in the choir whom she serves.  She is respectful, tactful, but strong and direct.
Learning: Maranda has learned the position well. She has taught those assisting her the new skills that she has acquired this year.
Job Specific: Maranda has done a very good job in her first year in the position.   The only areas of improvement would be the consistent weekly reporting of her work accomplished and the consistent straightening up of the workspace.

Attendance: Qamar has been repeatedly late for work. Sometime excusable and sometimes not excusable. He has had a difficulty giving advance notice to absences for a work shift. We have discussed this on several occasions.
Accountability: Qamar does have a great work ethic both in learning LEAN principles as well as application of those principles in a practical way.
Teamwork: Qamar brings his athletic skills to the workplace. He is on the soccer team and shows the same kind of teamwork in the workplace. 
Initiative: Once Qamar is given an assignment he works diligently and independently. However, when work is completed he does not seek out a new assignment.
Respect: Qamar comes from a culture where respect for another is a highly and required personal skill. He shows everyone the greatest and most humble respect.
Learning:  
Job Specific: Qamar has learned LEAN principles and their practical applications quickly. I will be disappointed if he doesn't maintain this same rate of learning

She is a team player and often steps up in the absence of teaching staff.  Alex demonstrates respect with all people and strives to learn and have personal growth.  Alex often goes above and beyond expectations. I am very excited that Alex will be a student leader next year.

Initiative: Joey completed his job assignments.
Respect: Before the disagreement, Joey was very respectful. After the disagreement, he became very hard to work with his peers and supervisor. He didn't respectfully deal with the conflict that had happened. The last 2 months I can't account for because of him switching positions.
Learning:  
Job Specific: Joey fulfilled his basic requirements until his disagreement. He was a hard worker until that point. Joey has not been with Admissions for the last few months so I can't relate to his new basic labor requirements. I am sure he will succeed in his new position.

40875: It was a joy to work under Robert Lewis for the duration of my employment as a switchboard operator. Robert always let us know how valuable our work was. I'm sure that the switchboard won't be the same under new management. I hope that in the future as I'm working within the media department of the TRC that I will continue to work with Robert to make valuable contributions for the college.

Attendance: While Jennifer is on time at times, she is not consistent with being on-time to meetings, programs and duty night and at times doesn't communicate with her supervisor about why she needs to be late or absent.
Accountability: Completion of job assignments in a timely manner has been inconsistent.
Teamwork: When Jennifer is present and focused, she works well with other team members.  However, she can be inconsistent with being on time and accountable to her team members.
Initiative: Jennifer does take initiative at times, but again, is inconsistent and often has to be asked to complete her assignments.

Accountability: Trevor did an outstanding job of managing the STARS report this year.  Neither one of us knew the extent of the data required to produce a thorough report.  Trevor tackled it like a pro.
Teamwork: Trevor was always fully engaged during our labor and group meetings and took an interest in the other initiatives underway by our office.  
Initiative: Trevor's position was brand new for the office of sustainability, so he did not inherit a road map or playbook for the position.  Instead, he creat ed it and will provide a legacy for others to follow.
Respect: Trevor is very professional and respectful. He has strong opinions, but is also equally engaged with listening to others and accepts differing points of view.
Learning: The entire STARS report was a learning curve that Trevor tackled like a pro.  He excelled at dialing into the details to determine what was needed so he could communicate effectively with staff.
Job Specific: I was very impressed with Trevor's maturity, professionalism, and abilities that far exceeded the basic labor requirements for this position.  I honestly believe that without Trevor's outstanding work, we could have never pulled off our STARS submission this year.  He has set Berea College on the right path with future STARS submissions.  He will be missed

Attendance: Excellent. Lilia is punctual and responsible about letting me know when she needs to change her times.
Accountability: Lilia does a great job of prioritizing her tasks, being organized, maintaining her work environment, and taking excellent care of college facilities and belongings. She has been especially diligent and requires special attention this year as we have moved and transitioned several times! The fact that she has also been a Country Dancer while being the costumer also gives her special high marks as she sometimes has to be extra diligent and organized to pay attention to dancing and making sure the others are costumed.
Teamwork: Lilia creat es a welcoming atmosphere in the costume room and works well with both the Country Dancers and the CD assistant. She has gone the extra mile this year to work with the new CD assistant to help orient her and work with her.
Initiative: Lilia does an excellent job of working with minimal supervision and has very good ideas of where to take her work and makes the effort to think creatively. She initiated working with the CD Assistant on ideas for promoting the Country Dancers and will let me know when she thinks of new things that would make her life and mine easier.
Respect: Excellent. She seems able to consider different points of view and to respectfully deal with different opinions, with a sense of humor.
Learning: As mentioned before, she initiated work with the new CD assistant to both help her do her job better, and make improvements in Country Dancers procedures and promotions. She is eager to learn new skills and to apply what she has learned to her life outside her labor position, and vice versa. This year she has worked on a marketing program to improve our social media and marketing presence on campus. 
Job Specific: Lilia has been an excellent costumer and was able to balance her duties with being a dancer this year most of the time. She has a positive, respectful, professional demeanor, as well as a good sense of humor that serves her well in working closely with the dancers and with me! Did I say she was organized? Very. Thank goodness! She has been a godsend in helping the Country Dancers through a very long period of transition from leaving Seabury Center, to a temporary stay in Alumni before being moved into a storage pod, then Woods-Penn Commons, and then finally back to Alumni. We will miss her greatly as she goes abroad next year but hope she will be back with us for her senior year.

Attendance: Ben has good attendance.  He arrives to work on time and is good at communicating about absences.  He did seem to struggle with illness this semester which put him behind in hours.
Accountability: Ben manages his time well and completes most of his job assignments with reliability.  He supports workplace policies and procedures, as well as takes care of college equipment, facilities, materials and work environment. 
Teamwork: Ben is a reliable member of the team which means doing his assigned areas consistently and attending labor meetings.  
Initiative: Ben requires some supervision to complete the less desirable aspects of his job.  He does complete his assigned areas dependably with moderate supervision.  He gladly helps when there are other tasks to be done throughout the building.  He gets started immediately after clocking in. 
Respect: Ben is respectful of others including me, his co-workers and the hall residents.  I have not seen Ben participate in any conflict but he seems to have an easy going personality and understanding of different points of view.  When I have given him feedback he takes it easily and adjust his accordingly. 
Learning: Ben keeps to himself for the most part which usually doesn't include sharing his knowledge.  He is interested in learning Japanese and Chinese and studying various Asian cultures.  He seems to understand the value of his job as he is a reliable worker. He has chosen to work in another department which I think is related to his future career goals.  It makes me happy to know he is taking the opportunity to get a head start in his career path through the labor program at Berea College
Job Specific: Ben has fulfilled his labor requirements and all the objectives of the facilities assistant job description.

Accountability: Caitlin is efficient and works quickly.  She has a routine to her work and is thorough. She supports workplace policies and procedures and takes proper care of college equipment, facilities, materials and work environment.
Teamwork: Caitlin demonstrates her understanding for the importance of her job by being at work everyday and completing her assignments with a high standard of cleanliness. She works as a positive team member by always doing her job without complaint.
Initiative: Caitlin willingly adjusts her assignment to the needs of the department and over all team.  She does her job with minimal supervision and is very adaptable. 
Respect: Caitlin deals with me, co-workers and residence with respect by consistently doing her job with minimal supervision.  She seems to avoids conflict but I would expect has an understanding of differing points of view. 
Learning: Caitlin expressed her desire to work as a librarian after she completes her degree.  And she took the opportunity provided through the labor program to get a head start on that goal.  She will be working in the library special collections next year because she showed her initiative and interest in learning new skills. 
Job Specific: Caitlin exceeded the basic labor requirements and objectives in her job description.  She has a high level of endurance for the mundane work of an FA.  She is an exceptional worker and will be missed in Deep Green Residence Hall and Facilities Management.  I wish her all the best in her passion for library science.

Attendance: Destiny joined our team in the Spring semester as 0-5hr contract.  She was a great asset.  But she attended work only half of her scheduled hours.  
Accountability: Since attendance affects all aspects of this evaluation, Destiny was not always at work and can not be considered fully accountable.  She does manage time well and works quickly when on the clock.  She followed all workplace policies and procedures as well as took care of college equipment, facilities, materials, and work environment. 
Teamwork: Since Destiny was only at work about half the time and was not able to attend labor meetings she did not interact with the rest of the FA staff much.  She was a team player in the sense that she did her work thoroughly and completely when she came to work.  She was very willing to collaborate but did not seem to understand her value in the department as a whole.  I take responsibility for not communicating clearly to her the need for her position and the way she was relied upon in the overall goal of keeping the Residence Hall clean.
Initiative: Destiny has great initiative.  She is willing to change and adapt to the needs of the day.  She also goes straight to work when clocked in.  Many times when she was not able to come to work, it was because she didn't feel she could give her all to the task.  I appreciate the honesty and the desire to want to fully engage in her work.  It was a hardship to not have her come in to work when scheduled though. 
Respect: Destiny is very respectful of others and the workplace.  She was always very courteous and honest.  I value her willingness to share her opinion and speak with authority about her needs.  I am very glad she signed up as a 0-5 hr contract because it allowed me to get to know her and I am excited to work with her this summer. 
Learning: Destiny strikes me as person who values learning to a high degree.  She did not fully apply that desire in her job as an FA.  I think she realized that a second job was a lot of responsibility and handled herself well, given the circumstances. 
Job Specific: In terms of the labor requirements, Destiny was not required to work any particular amount of hours.  She was in regular communication about her schedule and always let me know before her shift if she was not able to attend.  The overall goal of keeping the Residents halls clean was high on her priority list when on the clock.  She did not seem to understand her role when not on the clock.

Attendance: Augusta takes her position seriously and is a very dependable worker. She always alerts the office if she is ever delayed.
Accountability: Augusta is adept at managing time and uses her time effectively to complete assigned tasks.  She keeps busy with extracurricular activities, but never shirks her duties. i would like both jeweler's to keep the space a little cleaner and put tools back in there appropriate places when finished.
Teamwork: Augusta understands her role in working with the Outreach program. She is always willing to prepare for her teaching assignment and she does it well. Augusta is aware that her work is spread across the program and she adjusts quickly.
Initiative: I really appreciate how Augusta takes hold of new information and is quick to apply the new knowledge to her work. She routinely goes beyond the minimum and is expert at trying new ideas.
Respect: Augusta has a good heart and quickly reads a situation.  She is respectful even when placed in a position where others may not be pulling their weight. I do wonder if her colleagues sometime take advantage of her good nature. She is respectful and careful with the emotions of those around her.
Learning: Augusta is an aspiring art educator and shares her knowledge in the best of ways- by her example. Knowledge she has attained is quickly put to use. She readily takes the suggestion to do research and then applies it in her work. Augusta is good at applying new types of information and can quickly find connections between her various activities.
Job Specific: I am happy with Augusta's progress.  I want her to keep her passion for experimentation, and advance her quest of new skills. The area I wish her to improve is with a production sense.  By this I mean that I will push Augusta to complete a greater number of salable items. I will also require that some predesign and planning to take place.

Attendance: Missed 4 days this semester as of 4/19.  
Accountability: Kaylie is an asset to the department.  She is an excellent tour guide who shows a lot of passion about her job.  With regards to job assignments, outside of touring, I have given Kaylie 2 assignments.  One was to creat e a spreadsheet to capture the numbers of tours we are doing each day/week/month.  The other was to start development of a farm tour.  The first one is a fairly simple and straightforward project.  The second is more complex and requires a lot of research and organization.  The first task took longer than anticipated to be completed. I am unclear as to the progress of the second.  I believe that Kaylie's time outside touring is not always the most productive.  I would have liked to have seen her take more initiative with her down time, completing tour projects or helping out in the store.  
Teamwork: Kaylie is a very positive person and she brings that positivity to our store every day that she is here.  She always shows a willingness to work with everyone in the store, including me and the other store manager.  
Initiative: Last year, as a customer engagement specialist who worked the sales floor, Kaylie showed a lot of initiative and I did not feel that she needed a lot of supervision.  However, this year, after moving to be a tour guide, she isn't showing the same level of personal initiative that she did last year.  The first couple of months for all the new guides were spent studying.  But now that that period is over, I would have expected Kaylie to be the one to say "what needs to be done?"  But that hasn't happened this year.  
Respect: Kaylie exhibits a high level of professionalism when interacting with customers, peers, or managers.  
Learning: Kaylie is the first to speak up in meetings or trainings.  She engages gracefully in all conversations and is willing to share her experiences and knowlege in order to help others.  She exhibited an interest in acquiring new skills by stepping out to train as a tour guide.  I believe that Kaylie does recognize the value of her position here and how it enhances her personal development.  
Job Specific: Kaylie is truly an asset to this department and I am very glad that she chose to stay and be a tour guide next year as a secondary position.  I believe that she can and will be a positive influence on the new guides and all of the new staff.  Kaylie has the ability to achieve a much higher overall score by remembering that she is a part of the overall store, not just a tour guide and by showing initiative during her down times from touring and completing tasks in a timely manner.

Attendance: Adrianna missed 5 days this semester.  After the first 3, she was given a written warning.  
Accountability: When given a specific assignment, Adrianna usually completes it in a timely manner.  We talked about taking initiative last semester, but I still haven't seen her take any in the store.  If not given a specific task, Adrianna does not take it upon herself to find things that need to be done.  
Teamwork: Adrianna started off the school year with a bang.  Out of the gate, she looked like she was going to be a hard worker and a person that would do anything.  But as the year progressed, her motivation waned.  She is collaborative and respectful.  But doesn't show a lot of willingness or enthusiasm about work.  
Initiative: I feel like in order to stay on top of her responsibilities, that I have to constantly tell Adrianna what needs to be done on her next shift.  I feel like I have to provide more supervision that what should be required at this point in the semester.  
Respect: Adrianna is very respectful of her supervisors, coworkers and customers.

Attendance: Jeri is always on time for work and never calls in sick.  In addition to that, she is always willing to work extra when needed.  
Accountability: Jeri completes all assignments in a timely manner.  In terms of accountability, the thing I love most about Jeri is how she listens to constructive criticism and acts upon it.  She listens to what I say and then works to implement suggestions.  I have seen a huge amount of growth in Jeri this semester.  Moving into the role of receiving, she has taken this responsibility and shown ownership for it.  
Teamwork: Jeri is always positive when she's at work.  She is collaborative (sometimes to a fault - she can be taken advantage of because of her generous personality) with her supervisors and her co-workers.  Although Jeri did well on the sales floor, she seems to be flourishing in the role that she's in now (doing back of the house administrative duties)
Initiative: Jeri always finishes her assignments.  She is an employee with a high degree of responsibility.  And this will be appreciated by all future employers.  Jeri functions well with little supervision.  She asks questions when she needs to.  In order for her to move into the role of manager, what I need to see from her is the ability to calmly handle stressful situations that may arise when there are no managers present.  I need to see that she could critically think through the problem and make a decision that makes sense.  
Respect: Jeri is very respectful of her supervisors, co-workers and customers.  
Learning: Jeri is like a sponge and wants to learn as much in this labor position as she can.  I would like to see her start to step into the role of leader and mentor with the new staff that will be coming on in the Fall.  
Job Specific: Jeri is such an asset to the department.  She asks questions and she absorbs information and constructive criticism in order to become the best employee she can be.  I foresee her becoming a manager in the future.  This coming semester we will begin to refine those skills necessary to be in charge of the store and be a leader to the other employees.

Attendance:  
Accountability: 1.  Lily Anna had the onerous task of studying 2 tour scripts early on in the semester and she was the first to complete this and step forward and say she was ready to start giving tours.  2.  In her forward facing role as a representative of the college, she needs to dress more conservatively, recognizing who she is interacting with and being a little more conservative.  This pushes her outside of who she is as a person - but it is a learning experience for future jobs. 
Teamwork: Lily Anna is always supportive, respectful and cooperative with supervisors, peers, customers.  
Initiative: Lily Anna volunteered to take on the development of a new tour.  She is a self-starter and I see qualities in her that will make her a good manager.  My only constructive criticism regarding initiative is that I think there was a lot of down time this semester.  Once she had the two tours completed, this was time to either research and improve existing tours or spend time developing the new one.  
Respect: Lily Anna is very professional and always exhibits a high level of respect for anyone she is interacting with.  
Learning: Lily Anna has constantly demonstrated an interest in acquiring new skills (i.e. taking on the role of tour guide, learning ceramics, and she shares knowledge by speaking up in meetings and trainings.  I want to see her become a mentor and a leader for all of the new staff in the Fall, in particular, the new tour guides.  
Job Specific: Lily Anna is an asset to the department and after only one year - has shown the potential to become a leader and a manager.  There will be much learning ahead of her and many challenges as she takes on the role of manager.  I believe she has the capability to do this.  One thing she must work on is managing her anxiety.  As she moves into a role with more responsibility, left unchecked, her anxiety could get the best of her.  I believe  she has the ability to take control of it and manage it.

Attendance: Shelby has missed 2 days and has been late on a few occasions.  
Accountability:  
Teamwork: Shelby always has a positive attitude and she works well with everyone in the store.  
Initiative: Shelby will complete tasks assigned to her but takes very little initiative in staying busy and looking around to see what needs to be done on her own. 
Respect: Shelby is very respectful of her supervisors and her colleagues.  
Learning: Shelby never really showed an interest in learning anything new with regards to running the store.  She showed an interest in learning a craft, but that wasn't feasible this semester.  
Job Specific: Shelby completes tasks as assigned.  But in this particular position, I need someone who can take initiative and find things that need to be done without being told.  That has proven to be a struggle.  Shelby always brings a positive attitude with her to work and she can be engaging with the customers.

Attendance: Kat is always on time and never calls in sick.  She is very dependable.  
Accountability: Kat loves to work and be busy.  She doesn't like to stand around and not do anything.  She gets frustrated if others in the department don't show the same level of commitment and responsibility that she has.  Kat always completes a task list in a timely manner.

Respect: Kat is always respectful of her supervisors, co-workers and customers.  Kat needs to work on exhibiting a higher level of maturity in order for her professionalism to shine through.  
Learning: Kat definitely shows an interest in learning new skills. I would like to see Kat take a leadership role in the future, exhibiting a high degree of maturity and mentoring of the new staff in the summer and Fall.  To do this, Kat is going to have to work on her self-confidence.

Attendance: No absences.  Needs to be on time for opening so that she can prepare for any early morning tours and also so that she can be on time for 10:00 tours.  
Accountability: Becca had 2 tours to study for at the beginning of the semester.  I honestly think she was prepared for them before she admitted it.  I think there was just a lack of confidence on her part.    Becca gets great reviews on her tours.  
Teamwork: Becca always brings a positive attitude to work and she is a pleasure to work with.  She always demonstrates a willingness to work with her supervisors and her peers.  
Initiative: I do see Becca taking the initiative to work the floor when she isn't touring.  
Respect: Becca always shows a high level of respect for her supervisors, her peers and the guests that she tours and interacts with on the sales floor.  
Learning: Becca demonstrated an interest in learning a new skill by requesting to be a tour guide for the Spring semester.  I'd like to see Becca take the time to do research to make her tour even better.  
Job Specific: Becca consistently gets great feedback on her tours.  And when she isn't touring she helps on the sales floor without being asked.  Becca is an asset to the department.

Respect: Julia always exhibits a high level of professionalism while working in the store.  She is very conscientious.  She interacts well with her coworkers and her managers.  She is a little on the shy side when it comes to engaging customers.  But once over the initial hump, I have seen her be quite engaging with guests.  
Learning: Julia has demonstrated that she is interested in learning new things within our work environment by stepping up to do special projects next semester.  Julia also has an innate desire to teach.  She demonstrated folding techniques at our recent labor meeting and she loves to learn new things and share them with others.

Attendance: Kerringtan is always here on time and has never missed a day of work.  when she has needed to be off, she has taken the initiative to find someone to work for her.  
Accountability:  
Teamwork: Kerringtan is always positive and brings her positivity to the workplace.  She is always willing to do whatever is asked of her and she works well with her co-workers, the customers as well as myself and the other store manager.  
Initiative: Kerringtan does not need constant supervision.   She always finishes whatever I ask her to do.  I would like to see her take a more active role in the store when she is here, looking around to see what needs to be done and taking the initiative to do it.  I also recognize that this is difficult when you are only here one day / week (secondary position)
Respect: Kerringtan is very professional in her interactions with customers, co-workers and managers.  
Learning: Kerringtan has shown an interest in acquiring new skills by moving into the role of a tour guide next Fall.  I believe that when she is here as a primary position, she will step up and take a leadership role.  I believe that Kerringtan understands that all the skills she learns in this position will be valuable for her no matter what profession she chooses.  
Job Specific: Kerringtan is an asset to our store.  I look forward to having her in a primary role next semester.

Attendance: Katrina is always on time and never misses work and on top of that, always is willing to work extra if needed.  Katrina is very dependable.  
Accountability: Katrina always finishes tasks assigned to her.  She manages to get a lot of work done in a short amount of hours.  
Teamwork: Katrina is ALWAYS positive.  She is very collaborative and supportive and demonstrates a willingness to work and do whatever is needed to get the job done.  
Initiative: Katrina needs no supervision.  She is very trustworthy and dependable.  In the area of initiative, this is my hot button.  So, it would take a lot to get rated excellent on initiative.  Katrina is a self-starter and will do whatever needs to be done.  As just one recommendation for future improvement, I would say that Katrina needs to be more assertive and take charge.  If she was staying, I would want her to work on coming in each day and recognizing what needs to be done and then, as the store manager, delegating those tasks to others.  
Respect: Katrina is extremely respectful of her supervisors and customers.  She also treats her co-workers in a very professional manner.  She always conducts herself in a professional manner.  
Learning: Katrina has lead many of the labor meetings this year, exhibiting her effectiveness in sharing knowledge.  
Job Specific: Katrina has been an amazing student manager.  Her departure in graduating this May will be felt by the entire department.  She has such a great work ethic and such a positive attitude.  She exhibits many traits, that once refined, will make her a great manager, leader.  She is calm under stress and very level-headed.  Katrina was an asset to this department and will be an asset to any future employer.

Attendance: I know that Gabby struggled to keep up with her labor hours last semester.  But that has not been a problem this semester.  
Accountability: Gabby manages her time well!  She knows what she has to get done and she does it with no supervision.  
Teamwork: Gabby always comes to work with a positive attitude and collaborates well with her supervisors and her peers.  
Initiative: Gabby has a plan of what she needs / wants to accomplish and she takes the necessary steps to get it all done.  
Respect: Gabby is very respectful of her supervisors and her peers.  She conducts herself with a high level of professionalism.  This is evident in the fact that even though she is no longer a tour guide, she is still requested to give tours because of her professionalism.  
Learning: Gabby has demonstrated an interest in learning new skills by offering to stay this semester and maintain the window displays.  She is excited about exploring this more and learning how to improve on her existing, innate talents.  
Job Specific: Gabby is truly an asset to the department - in both the talents that she brings as well as her attitude and willingness to work as part of this team.  My only constructive comment would be that she needs to participate in the labor meetings and trainings that we have.  And by participating, I mean engaging and speaking out.  Gabby has leadership qualities and she speaks very articulately and she needs to share these qualities by being a role model for the other students.

Attendance: The semester Becca has had some issue with not being available for work. She and I have talked about it and reshaped our mutual agreement that a written schedule be kept.  Becca did attempt to always contact the office, and worked to make up missed hours, but was not always available at her scheduled time.
Accountability: Becca has struggled a little here this year.  In our conversations she acknowledged that some factors have affected her work and scheduling during the semester. In the evaluations I have encouraged both jewelry students to take better care of the studio and tools, putting things away and cleaning before leaving the studio.
Teamwork: Mecca will always pitch in to help and is always willing to help a customer with information.
Initiative: Becca is willing to go the extra mile to take on special commissions and work with jewelry customers.  This is strong point for her, but a complicated schedule sometimes leaves her stressed over the decision. We have discussed finding ways for her to keep production schedule that allows for extracurricular activities.
Respect: Becca is respectful of those she work with.
Learning: Becca tries new techniques and find ways to make this work.  I witnessed her strength in this area as she developed a method to replicate parts of a collectable metals casting.  I was impressed with her problem-solving.  I would like to see Becca become more involved with some of the projects related to Outreach.
Job Specific: Becca can accomplish any task she begins. She knows technique and can resolve most issues creatively. As mentioned before, issues complicated her ability to be reliable with work time, but her always made efforts to make up time.  Becca and I discussed how this can affect the ability for folks to rely on her. I think that a less hectic schedule would assist in her ability to spend more time as a designer in the jewelry studio.

Attendance: Hallie is always punctual and has never called in sick.  
Accountability: Hallie likes to be busy and will complete a task in a timely manner when things are given to her to do.  
Teamwork: Hallie has always shown a willingness to work and she is very collaborative with her supervisors and her peers.  She always comes to work with a positive attitude.  
Initiative: To Hallie's defense, she was new to the store this semester so it took her a while to feel comfortable.  Now that she's been here for a few months, I would have liked to have seen her look around and see what needs to be done without having to be told.  
Respect: Hallie always shows a high level of respect for her supervisors, the customers and her peers.  She interacts professionally with everyone in the store.  
Learning:  
Job Specific: For just starting with us in January, Hallie has done a great job settling in and learning what she needed to learn to help us out on the sales floor.

Attendance: Blue has missed quite a few days this semester due to personal and family emergencies.  
Accountability: Blue did a great job of coming in this semester and learning her two tours.  I feel like there's been a little down time in the last couple of months - since the tours were learned - that she could have helped out in the store.  However, in the last few weeks, Blue comes out on the sales floor without being asked whenever she is not giving a tour.  
Teamwork: No matter what is going on in Blue's personal life, she always manages to come to work with a positive attitude.  This is quite a asset of hers and I think it says something very powerful about her strength and determination.  
Initiative:  
Respect: Blue is always very respectful of her supervisors and her peers.  She is respectful and shows a high degree of professionalism on the tours - as she always gets great feedback from her guests and from development.  
Learning:  
Job Specific: Blue is a great tour guide and I'm thrilled that she has decided to stay on in a secondary position with us next semester.

Attendance: Sarah has been late and absent several times this semester.  
Accountability: Sarah always completes tasks that she's been assigned.  She also takes a high degree of pride in doing a thorough job.   I think sometimes Sarah can get tied up in details and not be as effective or productive as she could .  This summer, I'd like to see Sarah work on prioritizing her tasks.  Moving into the position of student store director, she will be pulled in multiple directions and on multiple projects.  It will be important that she knows what she has on her to do list at all times and that she prioritize them in accordance of importance or timing.  She should learn to take a few minutes at the beginning of each shift to lay out her day.  Good plans don't always get executed because of things that may happen throughout the day.  But planning helps to keep you on track.  I also want to see her ask for direction or re-direction when her plate is overflowing.  This is also the sign of good time management.  
Teamwork: Sarah ALWAYS demonstrates a willingness to work and she is collaborative with everyone - supervisors, co-workers.  She ALWAYS demonstrates a positive attitude.  I've never heard Sarah say a bad word  or negative thing about anyone.  In addition to being a good manager, she is also a good listener and shows a high degree of connectedness and empathy for her co-workers.  Sarah must be cognizant of this high level of empathy.  As a manager it is a tight line to walk between being connected and caring and being able to manage.  I have not seen this as a real issue yet.  But as Sarah moves more into the people management area of management, this could become a problem.  
Initiative: Sarah, probably more than anyone else in the department - takes initiative by looking around and seeing what needs to be done.  Next semester I need her to step this up by evaluating the overall needs of the department daily and delegating those tasks to other staff members.  Sarah needs no supervision.  She is fully capable of managing the store without me or Steve in the store.  She has earned that level of trust.  But she needs to be more confident in herself.  
Respect: Sarah is extremely respectful of supervisors co-workers and customers.  
Learning: Sarah loves to learn.  Even though she has been at the store for several semesters, I feel that there is still more for her to learn and I think we will see a lot of positive change taking place over the summer and the following semesters.  I want Sarah to take charge of the labor meetings this coming year.  She needs practice speaking in front of people in order to raise her confidence in doing this.  
Job Specific: Overall, Sarah is an excellent employee.  There is still a lot to learn and I think the upcoming semesters will be challenging for her (in a positive way).

Attendance: Excellent.
Accountability: Excellent. Matalynn is very efficient and works to ensure she is prioritizing her assignments. She keeps a very tidy workplace and is careful with college equipment.
Teamwork: Matalynn works well with me and with other labor students. She is a great team player and promotes a positive atmosphere. I'd like to see her take on more leadership as she gains more experience.
Initiative: Matalynn is very good with completing assignments and finding a way to complete assignments. I would still like to see her take more initiative, risks, and ownership, and use her imagination to push forward, as she still waits to receive assignments rather than creating her own way.
Respect: Matalynn is very respectful and exhibits professional conduct in the workplace. I haven't seen her dealing with conflict very much.
Learning: Matalynn is willing to share and acquire selected knowledge to assist her with the job. Perhaps it is more of a matter of prioritizing her energy in her first year at BC and having other priorities, but she has seemed to view her labor position more as a matter of getting a job done rather than as an opportunity to learn more. I hope that in her next job, which is of her own choosing rather than an assignment, that she will take more opportunities to learn.
Job Specific: Matalynn does almost everything I ask her to do, and does it well. She has been an excellent country dance programs assistant, with a pleasant and professional demeanor.

Attendance: Tsering exceeds in this area in that he not only arrives for work, as scheduled, and on the very rare occasion has had to reschedule, notifies me, he shows up ready to work with an outstanding positive attitude.
Accountability: Tsering, from the time he was a freshmen, does an amazing job competing assignments not only on time, but with exceptional results.  He basically has built data tracking and analysis for the office of sustainability from scratch.
Teamwork: Tsering can always be counted on to be an outstanding team member.  He consistently volunteers to help, and because of his strong work ethic, is an incredibly valued team mate.
Initiative: Like I said previously, our office would not have the sophisticated and valuable data tracking we have currently had it not been for Tsering.  I talk thru what I'd like to see in terms of data, and somehow, every time, he figures out a way to make it happen!
Respect: Tsering is extremely respectful and kind to all those he encounters.  He is a joy to work with.
Learning: As I mentioned earlier, Tsering has built our data tracking process and systems from the ground up.  He couldn't have done this with his strong willingness to roll up his sleeves and learn how to do something he's never done before... and has succeeded every time.
Job Specific: Selfishly, I'm already dreading Tsering's graduation day!  He has excelled in his position time and time again... consistently for the past three years.  I will be pairing Tsering with an incoming new labor student to learn from him all he's built and done for the Office of Sustainability.  Tsering has built a lasting legacy with his time here.  I hope he is as proud of his work as I certainly am.

Attendance: Jair continues to have an excellent attendance.
Accountability: Jair continues to be respectful of our office setting and all that entails.  He is helpful to all who come by and/or need assistance.  
Teamwork: JJ has fantastic work ethics/habits.  Our other student worker was out of commission some this semester due to foot surgery.  JJ had been trained well and did double-duty on many days. He is the consummate team player!
Initiative: JJ works extremely hard in all that he does.  He is now comfortable enough in his role that he does common things without asking.  I look forward to his return in the fall.
Respect: JJ treats everyone with respect and is very polite.
Learning: After a full academic year in the CCC office, JJ has a better understanding of his role and the role of the Center.  I am very excited that he wants to return to us next year.
Job Specific: JJ meets all of the CCC's labor requirements.

Attendance: Brenna had surgery early in the semester and was on crutches for several weeks.  She was always good to communicate to me her drs. schedule and should she need to arrive later than typically expected.
Accountability: Brenna is completing her 2nd year in the CCC.  She is the person I lean on the most and she knows what to do and when to do it!  
Teamwork: She has done a wonderful job in training our new student worker.  This was obvious in how he went about the labor position when Brenna was away due to her surgery.
Initiative: Rarely needs supervision.  I was able to take a week's vacation and Brenna & other student worker handled our Chapel lunch with no issues; I felt totally at ease leaving her in charge as did my co-workers with Brenna in charge.
Respect: Always welcoming to everyone who comes to our office and is very helpful to those who have questions.
Learning: Brenna has been very helpful this year in training our new office worker.  This has been very obvious in watching him do his job when she's not around.
Job Specific: Brenna is an excellent student worker!  As next year is her senior year, she will certainly be missed after she graduates (December 2017)!

40875: I do not agree with most of my supervisor's comments. I feel as if her expectations were unrealistic with the amount of time given for the project, and time should have been going towards finishing the book instead of having unnecessary meetings. I had a plan, lists of events, contact information, etc., and I feel like the team moved backwards to accommodate our newest addition and the changes that we were requested to make in the middle of the semester. I will admit that I did have some issues with time management because I was taking a very difficult course load as well as some extremely difficult personal issues. I do not feel as if I had adequate support in balancing this and work.

Attendance: Sierra gave notices when she would miss a meeting or be late. She had several times that she ran late or arrived later than her team.
Accountability: Sierra had challenges with her time.  She stated that her schedule changed often and did not clearly communicate all of her office hours regularly.  She often had to be reminded by email to follow thru with communications, and had touch bases to discuss improvements needed for follow thru and partnering with her Faculty advisor.
Teamwork: Sierra had challenges with her willingness to be a team player.  She admitted to being a micro manager to her staff and often  did not allow for their ideas and or using all resources to impact the success of the team. During meetings often the team appeared questioning of what work she has done and were reasonably upset when she used their work for her page, without permission or knowledge.
Initiative: Sierra completes some assignments especially when it came to her editing others work, but often had to be reminded thru email to take steps needed for a task (follow up email for labor day, to partner with Pinnacle, to communicate to faculty advisor, to thank others outside of Chimes for their help) As an Editor Sierra needed to keep her 0-5 in clear communication with the team so she would not miss anything and feel apart of the team. 
Respect: Sierra has challenges with authority. She enjoys doing things the ways she wants, example micro managing and not using all tools necessary (campus tools, and design tools).  What she sacrifices by doing this is her ability to gain insights and knowledge from everyone around her.  She is often short with her responses in meetings, to others, and in emails. Her awareness of how she impacts others around her is critical for her growth as an editor and to grow personally. She has challenges understanding the impact she has on others around her and how she deals with conflict. 
Learning: Sierra had low efforts in acquiring new skills and to impact the effectiveness of the team.  She was reluctant to use campus resources to help the team with events and planning. Sierra had challenges with sharing the editing role at the beginning of the semester.   
Job Specific: The objective of the yearbook is to produce a yearbook capturing that year.  At the end of the spring term the yearbook was not in its final stages of completion. Spreads have not been submitted for the team to review, and a proper plan has not been put in place to finish the book.  College decisions will have to be made about finishing the book and getting the work completed.

Attendance: Kerstin was an exemplary employee--coming on time, staying late and always letting us know ahead if she could not come on time for any reason.
Accountability: Kerstin manages time well and juggles many tasks. She is supportive of policies and responsible in every way. I could always count on Kerstin to keep up with the many demands of the social media portion of her job. She shone in everything she touched.
Teamwork: Kerstin has been a team player--within the Education Abroad side of things as well as the other 3 parts of the office. She gained trust and confidence in the process because our work is so intricately intertwined. Kerstin was good at keeping me apprised of her progress.
Initiative: Kerstin was great at taking initiative. She would schedule social media posts in advance... some posts were prescribed and others she invented on her own. Kerstin is a consummate self-starter with no need for supervision. Kerstin is always creative and appropriate. She checks back in when she needs guidance.
Respect: In this office, Kerstin has had ample opportunity to interact with people from all walks of life. She has offered kindness and respect to all--no matter how pushy the person might have been. All permanent staff in the office feel respected by Kerstin and have complete confidence in her ability to deal with conflict and issues as they arise.
Learning: Kerstin learned how to effectively manage social media, productively work in the office, to maintain strong relationships with others in the office and how to use various kinds of software. Kerstin honed her already-fine public speaking skills by volunteering to represent the office in many settings. She excelled at all of this.
Job Specific: Kerstin won the departmental labor award this year for her consistent excellence in helping the entire office function smoothly and for volunteering for extra duties in addition to excelling in all aspects of her education abroad duties. She helped many a student study abroad and promoted post-grad opportunities and other activities that creat ed an international climate on campus.

Attendance: Anna was the most punctual person in our office. She arrived early most days and gave advanced notification for the only time she needed to be absent all semester.
Accountability: Anna is upper supportive of policies and procedures. She excels at completing job assignments in a timely way. She competently juggles many tasks at a time. She has a back-up project to work on whenever her other tasks ran out. This was the annual report, and she anticipated including every event and prize.
Teamwork: Anna is a consummate team player. She collaborated well with the education abroad team and the entire office. She has a sense of how much her work ties in to the other procedures going on simultaneously and cooperates to make things run smoothly.
Initiative: Anna is good at finding tasks that have been left undone and finishing them. She is unstoppable when she encounters a sticking point. She is a creative problem solver and always finds a work-around.
Respect: Anna is respectful and thoughtful of others. She is careful not to engage in banter that crosses the line from teasing to disrespect. I haven't seen her deal with conflict, but perhaps that speaks to her laying the good groundwork so that conflict will not arise.
Learning: Anna entered this position with no office experience, so every task was new to her. She is a quick learner and took advantage of every opportunity to do so. She learned multiple software applications and application website functions. Whenever I had a complicated computer question, she became my go-to person because of how quickly her skills advanced.
Job Specific: Anna became our behind the scenes machine. She collected and organized data, corrected student study abroad budgets, obtained every single insurance card that this office facilitated, she kept records and problem solved and juggled key work components every day.

Attendance:

Initiative: Again, is not a self starter.
Respect: Her shyness, sometimes, comes off as a lack of caring, perhaps bordering on rudeness.  She is respectful, in most cases, but she rarely communicates with supervisors or co-workers
Learning: I am not sure how much she learned this year.  It seemed, at times, that simple skills learned last year were forgotten or ignores.  At times, Rachel appeared as if she did not want to be here.  She is profoundly intelligent and gifted in many areas.  I wish she'd have exhibited those skills more often.

There is little interaction with him at all except for at labor meetings and minor general requests. Therefore I feel that his ability to evaluate my work is low. Shan does not see me working with other people, check my times, or give me feedback on my work.

Attendance: Dakota had a difficult year.  He seemed overwhelmed at times when his classwork was heavy.  I believe he did the very best he could under his load. He always let me know when he had to meet with a professor.
Accountability: Dakota was successful in getting his work completed but struggled some and his teammates would assist him.  He was very accountable and did his best to keep up with all he had on his plate. 
Teamwork: I enjoyed working with Dakota and so did the staff.  He is a bright young man who adds much to the life of others and joy in the workplace.  
Initiative: Dakota gets caught up in conversations.  He enjoys people and social interaction. Custodial work can be boring at times and he is such a lively person.  However, he began when he came to work with no problems and would do whatever asked. 
Respect: Very, very respectful of staff, faculty and others.  He listens intently to another's view and kindly shares his own. 
Learning: Custodial positions do not offer the educational potential as do other jobs.  Dakota seems to enjoy learning and sharing ideas.  
Job Specific: Dakota performed his tasks as expected.  Here and there his teammates would complete some to help him.  He seemed to have a difficult year adjusting to the requirements of his college studies.  He is a pleasure to work with; in fact, I will miss our chats and his kindness.  He did not complete his full hours for the term.  I think the pressure of writing papers and class performance along with his dance activities drained him.  Best of luck to Dakota...I hope he continues at the College.

Attendance: Emma is very faithful to her duties and always gives advance notice of her other activities that may interfere with her position responsibilities. She would come in earlier or stay later to make up time missed.  
Accountability: Emma completed her work with seldom asking her team leader to fill in for her.  I highly recommended her for her next labor assignment with ease. 
Teamwork: Emma would ask me for additional work if she competed her assigned tasks.  She never seemed to mind helping another teammate in crisis.  
Initiative: Never had to look over this students shoulder at any time. I wish all had worked with the same kind of ownership of their tasks.   
Respect: Emma was a pleasure to work with and alongside.  She is a bright young woman who adds much to the lives around her.  
Learning: Emma enjoys learning and new experiences.  However, there are not many to learn as a custodian.  We valued her work and she proved her value!  
Job Specific: Emma was given the departmental labor award for her work ethic and dedication to the position. We wish we had ten more like her!

Attendance: Camden is very professional with his attendance.
Accountability: Cameron is very proficient with his time management skills.  Not only does he complete assignments given to him thoroughly and on time, but he offers more to the project that's extra work for him, that he completes in a very professional manner.
Teamwork: Cameron is a team member that you can count on.  He volunteers to help with office related events that are not directly in line with his position, and is completely dependable when it comes to follow thru.
Initiative: This area is where Cameron really shines.  He is a true self starter, very professional in his worth ethic, and someone I knew would get the job done with little supervision.
Respect: Cameron is very professional in the workplace.  The only suggestion I have is to filter some of his frustration with co-workers by asking the question... is this comment constructive, or am I just voicing my frustration?
Learning: I was really impressed with the way Cameron embraced his position.  He joined us mid-year without having any prior work experience in the energy and water fields.  That didn't deter him or his ability to learn what was needed to be effective in the position - he exceed my expectation in this category. I was also impressed with his ability to bring in other experiences he had with EPG and LEAN to add value to the position and outcomes.
Job Specific: As stated earlier, I was very impressed with how quickly Cameron embraced his position and was able to provide immediate value to it. I wish I had at least another year with him in this position!

Accountability: Cecelia struggled with knowing what to do sometimes, but when she had a clear directive that she knew how to tackle, she got things done quickly, usually before deadline.
Teamwork: Cecelia was uncomfortable working in an office team environment and would express this openly during team meetings.  She is an incredibly hard worker once she's given a specific task, but without a clear directive struggles to know how to help or what to do.
Initiative: Cece struggled quite a bit with this area.  When given a specific task, I was amazed at how quickly she got it done.  Because the events and training coordinator was a new position this year, and Cece joined us mid-year, it was difficult for her to work with such an unstructured role after working in recycling which is more straightforward. 
Respect: Cece was respectful when working directly with me and her co-workers, however, when she was uncomfortable with a job related meeting, she would let the room know of her discomfort in not understanding the task or that she has never known what she was suppose to be doing in her job, which is not a level of professionalism that would be expected in the work world. 
Learning: Cece is very bright and hardworking, but, based on my observation, once she determined that office work was not for her, and that she did not enjoy building her position and making it her own, she shut down.

Attendance: Brandon has had perfect attendance throughout the spring semester and always arrives on time for his scheduled shift.
Accountability: Brandon always stays on task and completes all job assignments in a timely manner.  In addition, he is always more than willing to take on additional tasks whenever needed.  
Teamwork:  
Initiative: Brandon never requires constant supervision and always stays on task.  With any task that he is given, I am fully confident that he will not only complete the task, but also put his full effort into it. 
Respect:  
Learning: Brandon came to Berea with prior experience for this position, so there wasn't a lot of on-the-job training required.  However, through his labor position, I feel that he has been able to enhance the great qualities he already possess in regards to time management, organization, and accountability.  In addition, I believe that Brandon has an appreciation for the labor program and for the opportunity he has had to build mentoring and networking relationships with staff members and other students within the office.
Job Specific: Brandon has a superior work ethic and has exceeded the expectations set forth for the position of Facilities Assistant.  He takes pride in his work and I am constantly impressed with the phenomenal job he does of keeping the Admissions Office and Sturt Cottage clean and well kept.  He pays attention to the smaller details that could easily be overlooked and always goes above and beyond what is asked of him.  Further, he is always willing to take on additional responsibilities such as hosting a prospective student overnight whenever there is a need, occasionally walking a prospective student to an on campus appointment, and socializing with guests when they are in the lobby.  Brandon is an all-around amazing person and his contributions to the Admissions Office have been invaluable.

Attendance: Jazmin is always on time. She always lets us know when she is going to be late well in advance and follows up with these communications. 
Accountability: She manages her time well and goes above and beyond to complete her tasks. She will communicate with the HM if she sees something wrong in the hall. 
Teamwork: Jazmin is quiet and kind of shy but she makes a great effort to engage with her team members.  During bonding, she made a point to bring other team members into the fold - engaging them and talking to them though most everyone was quiet. It has been witnessed that she even speaks to her teammates outside of the work environment.  Jazmin has improved in this area tremendously since last year. 
Initiative: Jazmin consistently keeps her area more than clean. She has been seen to remop an area where someone has walked across her floor.  She goes above and beyond. 
Respect: Jazmin is super respectful. 
Learning: This is Jazmin's second year as an FA. At the beginning of the year, we moved her from Kettering to Seabury hall.  She worked well in the transition. At the start of the second semester, she was instrumental in the transition of the new monitor - aiding in acclimating her to the hall and their operations. Jazmin wanted to remain and FA for the fall but has been encourage to work in another department to provide the same level of excellence there as she has as an FA.
Job Specific: Jazmin is fabulous. She consistently goes above and beyond to fulfill her labor requirements. Again, she has done such a great job that we have encouraged her to do something different - one to challenge her and, two, to share the awesome work that she does. She will be an asset to any department she is in.

Attendance: Stephen, throughout the semester, was very strong in this area, and this score could easily have been higher.  However, due to work commitments at home, he had to leave before hall closing, a critical time for all hands.  Since there was long-range communication of this need well in advance, few, if any, exceptions can be made.  
Accountability: Stephen works hard on assigned tasks and performs them well without additional need for comment.  This score would be a bit higher, but is impacted by the need to leave before hall closing.
Teamwork: Stephen is a strong member of the FA team in both James and Blue Ridge.  He is typically jovial and provides service with a smile.  
Initiative: Stephen saw a need in Blue Ridge for additional FA work, so he applied and took a secondary labor position to help address the need at a critical time.  As a result, the quality of that hall improved greatly.
Respect: Stephen understands the rank-and-file, having been a manager in the restaurant industry himself.  He brings that understanding to his labor position, and respects all supervisors and co-workers.
Learning: Stephen became interested in other positions in the department, and has been hired as a Resident Advisor for Blue Ridge in the 2016-17 academic year.
Job Specific: Stephen does his job well, shows ample respect for teammates, and is a valuable student worker.

Attendance: Victoria shows great effort in working as scheduled.  She somehow wound up a little behind mid-semester, but put her best foot forward and added some weekends to get her hours caught up.  
Accountability: When faced with a situation involving a deficiency in hours, she took the first steps to resolving the issue, politely asking to review her hours and being open to suggestions for addressing the deficiency.  She understands the critical nature of her position, and how important she is to the team.
Teamwork: The Hall Monitor of James Hall, Victoria's direct report, indicates that she is very respectful of her position and engagement with team members.  She goes above and beyond what is expected from all FA's.
Initiative: Victoria seldom (if ever) has any need for directive to accomplish tasks.  She is extremely reliable in this regard.
Respect: Victoria is extremely respectful of all supervisors and co-workers.  She communicates her needs well, and seeks out solutions when problems arise.  She is very open to individual differences, willing to discuss differences of opinion with respect.
Learning: Victoria performs assigned tasks, and definitely goes above and beyond in many ways.  However, this position, in and of itself, provides few additional opportunities for training beyond normal expectations.  She is willing to learn anything related to her position, though.
Job Specific: Victoria is a strong worker as an FA -- she learns what is required, focuses well, and performs all directed tasks.  She takes initiative when she can, and meets problems with her performance head-on.  A solid member of this team.

Attendance: Michelle is typically EXTREMELY attentive to labor hours and follows the provided work schedule.  This score would be noticeably higher if she had not needed to leave before hall closing.  Advance notice from supervisors was communicated, but she had transportation issues at the last minute.  Unfortunately, hall closing is a critical time, and few, if any, excuses for absences can be tolerated.
Accountability: Michelle is fantastic in this area.  She often holds herself to a higher standard of accountability than what is expected.  She was diagnosed with a serious illness near the end of Spring Term, but attempted to work through until simply ordered not to.  She received a departmental award for Best Facilities Assistant in Spring 2016 as a result.
Teamwork: Michelle does her work well, and helps teammates often when work demands increase unexpectedly.  There are not often opportunities for FA's to work as a team, but she definitely does her part.
Initiative: Typically, Michelle needs no supervision, other than direction on tasks.  Many times, she seeks out additional tasks and suggests what she can do to help.
Respect: Michelle is extremely respectful of fellow workers and supervisors.  She is strong with communication when problems arise.
Learning: Michelle has consistently demonstrated an interest in further work with the department, and has obtained a leadership position in Fairchild Hall for the 2016-17 academic year.
Job Specific: Michelle consistently goes above and beyond what is expected, especially for a first-year student worker.

Attendance: Tony usually shows up on time when scheduled. There were a handful of times when he wouldn't come in and would make the hours up without letting me know when but overall he did very well.
Accountability: I can count on Tony to get his job done anytime he shows up. I can count on Tony to do anything I ask him to do.
Teamwork: Tony always looks for ways to work with myself and or his coworker. He excels when working with a team and shows promise with leadership skills.
Initiative: Tony is always happy to let me know if he needs something. If he finishes work early he looks for other things to do and does not stop until he is done.
Respect: Tony respects the job and the importance of the job. He understands that someone has to clean and respects that he was the one that had to do it. He handles himself very well given the responsibilities of an FA.
Learning: Tony always looks to know more about the job and does very well. Anytime he learns new things he applies them and looks to help his coworker as well.
Job Specific: Tony knows his job and does it when he is there. He does not need coaching along and has grown a great deal since the beginning of the academic year.

Attendance: Theresa is generally strong in this area.  As a 20-hour employee, she knows it is critical to notify us if she needs to be out, and she does so.
Accountability: Any time Theresa cleans, the work is done exceptionally well, which is always a challenge in first-year male hall.  
Teamwork: Theresa, due to her personal scheduling requirements, has little time to interact with teammates, but she works well with supervisors.  Fortunately, since most FA work is performed individually, this does not detract from her overall performance.
Initiative: Theresa can be relied upon to do all that she is asked.  Due to her extensive labor contract, there is little, if any, time to pursue above and beyond that particular calling.
Respect: Theresa works well with supervisors and treats people with respect, even when treated disrespectfully.  She shows great maturity in that regard.
Learning: Theresa consistently works to make the best use of her time on the job.  Throughout the year, her personal performance (which was already quite good to begin with) has improved, and the hall has improved on the whole, largely due to her effort.
Job Specific: Theresa is an outstanding FA and will excel in any job she pursues in the Labor Program in years ahead.

Attendance: Stephen had some difficulties early in the semester with attendance, which led to some communication and suggested directives.  However, the gap was manageable.
Accountability: Certain areas of the hall were reported to be in less than perfect condition for periods of time, and some of these areas were Stephen's responsibility.  This improved throughout the semester, once his attendance issues were addressed.
Teamwork: Stephen generally works well with the team, but sometimes needed additional motivation to realize his importance to the overall cleanliness of the hall.
Initiative: There were a few times when it was obvious that some of Stephen's assigned tasks were not being completed. I feel that his level of initiative will improve in a position more suited to his abilities.  
Respect: This position does not always lend itself to sharing of ideas, but I heard no ill reports of disrespect from Stephen's performance.
Learning: Stephen showed some interest in an FA position next year, but these duties will be assigned to Facilities Management next year.  He was advised to seek a position through their department.
Job Specific: Overall, Stephen's performance this year could have been much better.  Attendance was the key factor in the issue, though, and could easily be improved with a bit more attentiveness.

Teamwork: Awa is more than willing to work with the team as asked and needed during meetings and team cleaning.
Initiative: Awa has challenges being consistent in completing her job assignments without supervision.  She often needs her supervisor to check on her that she is working or to review her sections that it is cleaned to standard. Received an email from Darlene Stocker on 2-11 to understand her expectations of the labor program and her assignment.
Respect: Awa shows professional conduct in the workplace. In the beginning she had challenges with engaging in touch base conversations, but communicates with respect for her peers and supervisors.
Learning: Awa can be affective but often needs to be reminded after conversation and review of the job duties and expectations.
Job Specific: Awa has communicated that she fully understands the job but has shown inconsistent results of follow thru and ability to successfully fulfill the requirements and objectives of her postion.

Attendance: Stephen typically attends as expected to work.  However, even when provided advance notice of hall closing needs, he needed to leave early to meet work requirements at home.  Hall closing is a critical time, so this cannot be ignored; however, he generally is extremely attentive to attendance needs.
Accountability: Stephen is a strong worker, and completes all assigned tasks thoroughly.
Teamwork: Stephen is a strong member of the FA team in James Hall, and supports his supervisors and co-workers in getting the job done.
Initiative: Stephen understands his position from multiple standpoints, as a hall resident, a former restaurant manager, et al.  As such, he seeks out additional opportunities to work even harder than expected.
Respect: Stephen is a strong communicator, and brings his supervisory experience to the table in dealing with issues between co-workers.  He is an asset to the team in this regard.
Learning: Stephen became interested in other positions in the department early in the semester, and landed a position as a Resident Advisor for Blue Ridge next year.  I ahve no doubt he will be an asset there, as well. 
Job Specific: Stephen is a solid worker and completes assigned tasks well, and often goes beyond what is expected.  His overall score would be quite a bit higher, were it not for the eleventh-hour need to miss at the critical hall closing time.

Attendance: When the student who fulfilled the primary labor position for lab assistant decided not to return to school this term, we experienced a major breach in our lab needs. Brianna volunteered to fulfill a secondary position. She made adjustments in her other primary labor assignments and worked on a regular basis three days per week to fulfill critical needs for our needs in the lab. She also made arrangements to attend particular course events to offer feedback, make observations, and support food preparation/production as our primary lab assistant would do. She was punctual, dependable, and very effective in this role.
Accountability: Brianna, constructed her schedule for work, was flexible with her hours, which enabled her to work between the end of lab sessions on Wednesdays and Monday of the following week for the next lab sessions. She completed the laundry, set up equipment as guided by me, and performed all supportive tasks that contributed to excellent and efficient lab sessions. The level of cleanliness of the lab was excellent throughout the term.
Teamwork: Excellent communicator; worked collaboratively with members of the class, my TA, and me. Was supportive of the flexible needs for our events. She volunteered to prepare some items to support the events of the class (brunch, cake decorating, reception, spring party, and formal dinner. She is very collaboratively. She transported left-over staple supplies from another class lab practicum that is conducted in the Home Management House to the Emery Building. This enabled effective use of staple supplies, supported our inventory of ingredients, and reduced food costs for some of our lab work.
Initiative: Asked questions for clarification. Took initiative to proceed with specific tasks to support the needs of the course on a weekly basis.
Respect: Very professional; good people skills. Asked good questions. Work effectively with TA, each student in the class, and the course instructor. She also interacted really well with guests at particular events (the formal dinner, the reception, and spring party).  
Learning: Brianna was willing to step out of her comfort zone, learn, and contribute to the class. For instance, for the cake decorating demonstration, we had a guest presenter for this presentation. Brianna volunteered to bake the cakes and prepare some areas of the lab to support this demonstration. On another occasion, the formal dinner, she volunteered to work with me as the waitstaff for this five-course meal. She demonstrated a definite interest in acquiring new skills and knowledge. She asked good questions, followed guidelines, and worked really well to support both front and back-of-the house activities for this formal dinner.
Job Specific: Brianna exceeded the basic requirements. She was most supportive, flexible, and able to fulfill any responsibility that we needed throughout the course.

Job Specific: Amanda has been a solid worker and a lot of help to our efforts this semester.  With only a semester of work she has shown initiative and willingness to aid in whatever assistance is needed to get the work done.  Much thanks.

Attendance: Daniel had trouble keeping up his weekly hour requirement. I believe this was mostly due to medical issues, so I am not rating him below the "meets expectations" range. He was always willing to work with me on changes to his schedule in order to make up missed time.
Accountability: Daniel seemed to struggle with time management and was seeking medical intervention to help with this. Aside from his difficulty finishing assignments, I would rate him as very trustworthy. 
Teamwork: Daniel took an active interest in supporting the work of other Development staff. He also befriended other students in College Relations, despite the wide variations among their various job descriptions. He represented us well in group labor meetings.
Initiative: Daniel had no problem starting and suggesting projects, but needed to work on completing them. I am still rating him within "meeting expectations" because I believe his attendance issues made it especially difficult to resume and finish tasks.
Respect: Daniel's respectful conduct and positive attitude made him a great asset to our office.
Learning: I expect Daniel would have scored higher in this area had he finished out the semester. We were planning at least one more assignment that would have been an excellent learning opportunity for him.
Job Specific: Until Daniel left mid-semester, he was on the right track for meeting his job requirements. I regret we did not get to finish out the year!

Attendance: Brittany has been present and punctual for most Labor meetings, staff meetings, and one-on-ones. She has communicated any changes in her duty shifts in advance and has taken the initiative to help others with duty nights. She has been communicative about absences, early leaves, or tardies.
Accountability: Brittany has shown to be a very accountable team member this semester, essentially supervising the Home Management House on her own. She always completes administrative tasks and has been very consistent with holding her housemates accountable for cleaning responsibilities. In addition, she was eager to provide assistance to the Student Life Team during Ground Level Opening events and interviewing processes. She implemented several successful programs for the campus, including Stress-Less and the Title IX Spotlight Speaker, and Home Managements. She took great effort to make connections with her housemates and  creat e outcomes-based programs. 
Teamwork: Brittany has been present for team activities has taken the initiative to creat e strong bonds with the Deep Green Leadership. She has shown to be a positive, highly valuable addition to the Res. Life Department. For the Spring semester, Brittany collaborated with campus partners to implement an effective stress-reduction program (Counseling Services were very impressed!). Moreover, Brittany has strived to make connections and support her residents.  
Initiative: I feel Brittany has taken an appropriate amount of initiative and has gone beyond expectations to assist her Res. Life teammates. She acts autonomously within her role, yet does not hesitate to ask questions if she is unclear of expectations or protocol. I appreciate her willingness to be flexible as we both adjusted to competing obligations throughout the semester. Within her role at HMH, I feel that Brittany has gone "above and beyond" to have a presence in her community and to make connections with each individual resident--this is reflected in her residents’ and team members’ frequent praise of her work. 
Respect: Brittany is respectful in her interactions with others. 
Learning:  
Job Specific: Brittany fulfills and exceeds the requirements of her position.

Attendance: TaLaka was present at most required meetings and events. 
Accountability: In terms of accountability, TaLaka performed her duties as assigned, but took some prompting or extra guidance. This term, her collegium member promoted her to HM in hopes that the self-directed model of the position would cater better to her personality and promote her student success. In some ways this proved to be true. However, she struggled to complete things like work orders in a timely fashion and she did not take initiative with regard to additional facilities concerns that were not automatically prescribed in her assignments. This included filth on the front porch, emergency lights going out in stairwells, the basement sink being stopped up, the lights on the porch being out without being addressed, and a washer that was not functioning properly for weeks without a work order having been placed, yet an out of order sign had been placed on it.
Teamwork: TaLaka would collaborate when requested by me or a teammate and would sign up for shifts when the department called for it. There were times that she switched shifts or covered for her teammates and at times she was engaged as a team player. However, there were times that she seemed annoyed to be in meetings which impacted the team culture negatively.
Initiative: At no point this year did TaLaka go above and beyond in any area. It was clear that this job was not a priority and without direct instruction, she did not take ownership of the building in terms of its cleanliness or upkeep.
Respect: There were many cases where TaLaka displayed a less than respectful attitude, both towards her superiors and towards her peers. Her negativity sometimes clouded staff meetings and made her unapproachable at times. TaLaka allowed her stress with academics and personal relationships to affect her job performance. When things were okay in her personal life, her work was okay...when things were not okay in her personal life, work and her respect for the position took a major backseat. In incidents of conflict, TaLaka displayed blatantly disrespectful behavior, specifically towards her collegium member. Any time she was given feedback about work-related matters, TaLaka would not accept the information in a professional manner and has stated that she is "not going to do it" when told to complete certain tasks. Her behavior could be described as aggressive at times.
Learning: In the beginning of the spring semester, TaLaka showed an interest in being a strong HM. She sought out help from her collegium and HC. 
Job Specific: The quality of TaLaka's work, although needing prompting, was good. However, a large piece of the job is being accessible and approachable to residents. Because of her negative attitude towards the job at times and lack of presence in the hall outside of her scheduled hours, it was difficult to see how residents felt comfortable going to her. Namely, her collegium member had to ask her to remove her headphones while on office hours and had to explain that she does not come off as approachable if she is studying with headphones in her ears while on the job.

Attendance: Jacob is very strong in his area.  He seldom has need to miss an assigned meeting or task, but always provides advance notice.
Accountability: There has a been a great deal of growth for Jacob in this area this year.  He has learned a great deal about accepting responsibility for tasks that he delegates to others. Ultimately, he understands that, if a delegated task is not completed, he might have to address that task personally.  Many times this semester, he stepped up when a leader was needed in the moment.
Teamwork: At times, Jacob can be a bit direct, which can be disconcerting for others.  He is very aware of this, and is developing his understanding for how this directness can have less than desirable consequences, such as being misunderstood.  
Initiative: At times, Jacob needs a little nudge to see needs and take action.  Some of this may be due to a lack of experience in custodial supervision.  However, he responds very well to directive and has a strong interest in doing the job well, and is always willing to learn more about how to perform better. 
Respect: At times, Jacob rubs other supervisors the wrong way, and he sometimes lets comments from teammates and other supervisors upset his ability to function to full potential.  I think this is mostly due to communication issues.  Jacob is very willing to engage in level-headed discussion of differing points of view, though, if he feels the environment is on a level playing field.
Learning: Jacob and I had a serious discussion about accountability early in the semester, and he took that to heart, stepping up to the leadership role far more often, demonstrating his concern and willingness to improve, and asking for guidance when he was unsure about what action to take.  He has been accepted for a second year to an internship in his academic field, and is very interested in learning through labor.
Job Specific: There were a few times I was concerned about Jacob's overall performance with this position, but when needs were addressed, he was open to learning how to improve, and he did.  I feel that he will excel in his next position as a result of his growth this year.

Attendance: Went above and beyond expectation when it came to his job. He was certainly dependable in this regard.
Accountability: Seemed to have a lot on his mind. Was accountable certainly, but also seemed to have stretched his schedule which reflected in some of his nightly programs.
Teamwork: Never missed a point on this. He worked well with everyone, including the Talcott RA's, with teamwork being one of his strongest attributes.
Initiative: In terms of writing work orders and working with facilities, this would have been a 10. However, with the stretched schedule it seemed difficult for him to creat e newer prog.
Respect: From residents to coworkers and executives, he was always respectful. No doubt that this was his strongest trait.
Learning: While not going all the way out of his way to learn things, he aptly learned what he needed to for the position.
Job Specific: Well met by all expectations. He did his job well.

Attendance: Cameron is present for all staff meetings, labor meetings, and leadership meetings. Also, Cameron is very participatory in hall programs.
Accountability: Cameron completes requirements of his job--we would like to see stronger administrative skills (such as work order follow-up and submission). He completed programming this semester and collaborated well with others. He was consistent in follow-up with a very difficult resident situation on his floor. Cameron has strong leadership qualities; we would like for him to have more comfortability being in a leadership role. 
Teamwork: Completing minimum requirements of position but did not seem to increase interaction on floors or with a diverse resident population. Still works well with the staff, but works alongside others and does not delegate tasks or such.
Initiative: Would have like to have seen more in terms of programmatic efforts--the game night waned throughout the year, but was not delegated or revised. Played a support role in nearly every program. We believe that Cameron has great initiative when it is something he is passionate about.
Respect: Always respectful in his interactions. 
Learning:  
Job Specific: Cameron completed the requirements of his job. We would like to have seen more interaction with others, leadership roles, and interaction with staff

Attendance: Zacchea has improved with balancing her schedule in that she provided a game schedule to the HC at the beginning of the semester and communicated when her practices would be over to avoid schedule conflicts.  However, there were still occasions where Zacchea was late to meetings without proper prior notice. There is still room for improvement in regards to managing and organizing her schedule.

Teamwork: Zacchea works well with the team.  She promotes a positive atmosphere. 
Initiative: Overall, Zacchea has improved in initiative - especially with bulletin boards. She is working to complete the tie dye program this semester. Zacchea collaborated with Seabury hall to do a program. She ran a tie dye station which was very popular. She did all of the ordering of shirts, purchasing the dye and getting all of the supplies prepped and set up.
Respect: Zacchea is always respectful. 
Learning: Zacchea has mastered work orders.  Our hall is never in need when it comes to supplies. She has worked well as a conduit between residents and facilities.

Attendance: James goes extremely far in this department, often working so much he has to be told to slow down and reduce the amount of hours worked.
Accountability: James definitely excels in the area of accountability.  He supervises and handles nearly all management issues for James Hall, and in a timely fashion.  He also excels in fastidious reporting of work orders to Facilities Management.
Teamwork: James works extremely well with co-workers, despite admittedly not always being known as a "people person."  He addresses the FA's under his watch with respect and treats them all as valuable team members.
Initiative: One of the greatest things about James's performance as a student supervisor is that he is always looking for ways to head off serious problems before they begin.  Despite coming off to some as rigid, he's quite flexible and understanding when the need arises for sudden shifts in responsibility.  He asks for assistance when he needs it, but generally, he knows what to do and puts plans into action.
Respect: James is generally strong in the respect department, but sometimes does not come across as such because of his directness.  Some might view this as disrespect or inability to handle differences of opinion, but in most cases, his directness is about focusing on the job at hand.  This comment is really a concern about how he initially engages new supervisors and teammates.  I have had the benefit of working with James throughout his time at Berea, and I know and understand how he thinks.  Not everyone will have that benefit.
Learning: James is always interested in learning what it takes to get his current job done.  He shows less interest in expanding knowledge outside of what is immediately needed.  He is more of a doer and not much of a dreamer. He leads by example and willingness to perform task, and doesn't tend to focus much on "vision" and "mission statement" development, which can be okay.
Job Specific: James is a solid employee and an asset as a Hall Monitor to James Residence Hall.  He meets and/or exceeds most of my expectations.

Attendance: Alex attendance was good this semester.  Alex has taken in to considerations needed time off and transition times and has made any accommodations with me. 
Accountability: Alex has taken on the scarf waffle and plaid illusion weaves this semester.  I can count on her to get a scarf done in the targeted time zone.  Her edges and beat on these weaves are very consistent.  
Teamwork: This semester Alex helped with sectional warping and warping on the warping mill for her scarves.  She has also been doing the short runs of odd plaid illusion warps to use the odd inventory warp up.
Initiative: Alex has taken the initiative to take some notes on the plaid illusion process.  She seems to need this in the beginning, but once she has the process underway, she only uses this as a reference.
Respect: Alex has a great way of communicating the processes of weaving as well as the history of Berea College to our guest and tourist.
Learning: This semester Alex has been learning how to do wider warps on the warping reel.  She has started the baby blanket prototype warps for the Confetti Block Grid series.
Job Specific: Alex has done very well this semester in all aspects of weaving.  She has embraced the different aspects of production weaving and has worked on stream lining her approaches to the set up process.  Her weaving times have increased greatly and this will be a great addition to meeting buffers next Fall on our 2016 scarf series.

Attendance: Austin has been good about giving notice on his attendance conflicts.  With a full plate, he is juggling several obstacles. 
Accountability: Austin has done very well in increasing his time on the fly shuttle.  Most importantly I have seen his quality jump way head, and his ability to mend threads on the loom has increased our product output. 
Teamwork: Austin has been a great team player.  His ability to learn from his coworkers and to assist in any way has shown great leadership.
Initiative: Austin has taken so much initiative to become a better weaver.  He wants his product to represent quality, and takes all measures to reach this personal goal.
Respect: Austin is always willing to assist any student or tourist with any questions about our program or the Berea College mission.  He is excellent at explaining the complete process of weaving.
Learning: This semester, Austin came with prior knowledge of weaving, but has been learning the production side of weaving.  He has done sectional warping and the warping reel, mended imperfections in the warp while weaving, and woven very consistent yardage and units in the bread napkin series.
Job Specific: Austin has done very well in weaving.  He has gained a greater understanding on the weaving processes, and the history of Fireside weaving.  Next year his focus will be to maintain the bread napkin series, help with baby blanket orders, and to help design some new scarf or other products on the smaller AVL.

Attendance: Eva has wonderful attendance.  I can count on Eva to be at work on time. She is very accountable on attendance and is always ready to start when she arrives.
Accountability: This semester Eva has taken on a broader range of versatility.  Since we were down some weavers I have had to move Eva to various weaves that needed to be done.  She has been warping and setting up looms from 12 epi rugs to warp faced ones.
Teamwork: Eva attitude is about teamwork.  The fact that she is knowledgeable about the entire process allows Eva to be diversified in many areas.  She can assist me or help teach other students the various processes of weaving especially sectional warping.
Initiative: Eva takes the initiative to seeing that things get done in the studio.  Not only does she monitor her area of rag rugs, Eva has been helpful in working with the new tour guides and in assisting any tourist.
Respect: In my studio, not only do I see that Eva has respect, but I respect her as a wonderful student worker.  She is very considerate to me and strives to have a productive day.
Learning: This semester Eva has almost woven all of the Berea forest Trails warp faced rag rugs for the catalog.  She has had to tackle various fabrics with different cuts.  Her math background has allows her to calculate the appropriate percentages needed to weave these rugs. 
Job Specific: Overall Eva and the weaving program have been a great mix.  She has a wonderful work ethic that allows her to self-analyze her weaving procedures and change things if needed.  She finds better ways of doing things that allow her production to increase.

Attendance: Abigael's attendance is stellar. She understands the work that is needed in order to effectively assist our international students. She consistently arrives early, will stay late when needed and sometimes without being asked. She provides enough notice when able to notify me or absences or tardiness. She has missed very few days (0-5) in the entire year she has been working as my Senior Assistant.
Accountability: Abigael does complete assignments on time, supports policies and procedures and ensures proper care of college equipment. However, when she feels rushed or overwhelmed. She makes minor mistakes which cause parts of projects to have to be redone causing delays or the work to be completed by someone else. This will be one of our coaching points. 
Teamwork: She works well with others in the office. Takes initiative to offer support when needed. Is also available if help is needed. 
Initiative: Abigael has great initiative. If she can predict that a situation will require deeper problem solving she jumps to the task without being asked. Following through until she has exhausted all of her own options and then asking for assistance if needed. 
Respect: Abigael is respectful to peers and staff. She is making great strides in being mindful in how she approaches a situation as not to off put the individual she is speaking to. We will continue to sharpen this skill over the next semester. 
Learning: Abigael is interested in pursuing a career in Project Management. She takes advantage of learning opportunities so that she can be improve on her personal career development skills. She willingly shares information with others. She can have a conversation on a topic she is familiar with and then later send the individual helpful additional information without being asked. So that they can enhance their own learning if they so choose. 
Job Specific: Abigael is a hard worker. She can accept constructive criticism. I have no doubt that by her final semester she will be a stellar labor student. She is patient, kind, and a responsible young lady. She has worked well with the information given to her about her job as it is ever changing. She manages to remain resilient and find a place to learn from the experience.

Attendance: No explanation needed here. You don't come, or you're late. You give excuses that don't add up.
Accountability: You aren't very accountable and trusting in you to be able to do the job is extremely difficult. You also don't adhere to policies under recreation.
Teamwork: Decent team member. Knowledge of the rules and preparedness for work hurt the team. Also showing up late hurts too.
Initiative: You don't step up and have no true desire to do so. You do what you are told, but with, and on you own time and with things said under your breath.
Respect: You do not take this job seriously and have a disrespectful attitude toward leadership with your actions and lack of readiness/preparedness for the job.
Learning: The lack of knowledge shows your lack of reading/learning the rules to the sports we required this year. You get by, but it clearly shows in your work.
Job Specific: This is just not the job for you.

Attendance: We know you had softball this semester, but it hurt your attendance score because when you are not here, we hurt a little being short staffed and having to compensate.

Teamwork: You are a solid team member and you d a good job when you are here. We value the work you do and your presence is very important to us.

Respect: You are very respectful.
Learning: You still have a lot to grow in and you can take the job a little more serious.

Attendance: There on time. Gives advance notice when you're not going to be at work.
Accountability: Time management is an issue. You protect the equipment well and make sure no one else is destroying it. Looks out for the safety of others.
Teamwork: Work on keeping comments about staff to yourself or with leadership. Just because someone isn't as strong as a ref doesn't mean they can't get the job done.

Respect: Have to work on how you talk to people. You're leadership, so what you say gets heard by everyone, language while working.
Learning: Be willing to listen. Sometimes people have valuable things to say but if you're not trying to listen you won't learn.
Job Specific: Have to understand each job has different requirements. Do what your job requires and makes suggestions if you see others not doing theirs.

Job Specific: Steven is an engaging young man.  But his absences from work have been a challenge throughout the semester.  He has improved this term, but still continues to neglect the schedule.  When here, he is a wonderful member of the housekeeping team, and always seems upbeat and positive while doing some rather mundane tasks.  It's my hope the Steven can find work that is inspirational to him.

Attendance: Layne is always on time. She is one of the most impressive students I have had the pleasure of working with.
Accountability: Layne was more of a colleague than a labor student. She lead by example. Her accountability was a role model of the other students.
Teamwork: Layne leads by example. She is the supreme team member. She leads when she needs to and encourages when she can.
Initiative: Layne is a self starter. If she sees something needs to be done she does it or facilitates having it done. We basically touch base from time to time. 
Respect: Layne works well with everyone.
Learning: Layne is one of if not the most skilled in the program. She is always learning and has to only be showed once. Even more, Layne takes that knowledge and builds on. She takes it to another level.
Job Specific: Layne was the perfect supervisor.

Attendance: Ricky stopped coming to schedules hours almost immediately once the term began. 
Accountability: Though he normally followed through with his assignments, due to his lack of attendance, it was hard to follow up with his assignments.
Teamwork: When he was present, he worked very well with this fellow students
Initiative: Normally, very high. This semester was an oddity. 
Respect: He has always been respectful. 
Learning: Normally, he is an engaged learned, just not this term. 
Job Specific: Again, this was a rough term for Ricky. I hope he returns this fall ready to return to his normal level of performance.

Attendance: Tyler had several issues with attendance that I expect to see improved.  He managed to work 151.37 hours which is just enough to stay off probation but falls short of the expected 160 hours for students working in the program.  We have had several conversations about this throughout the term.  Some of the absences were no call no show types.
Accountability: Attendance issues affected this score more than anything.
Teamwork: Although Tyler works well within the team, the attendance issues hindered Tyler from developing deeper understandings of teamwork.
Initiative: This has been an area that we have had ongoing conversations about since his coming to Berea.  The ability to "find" constructive things to do within work reflects valuable initiative.
Respect: Tyler has no issues here.  He deals with staff and students in a genuine and positive way.   I find him a joy to be around.
Learning: Tyler has the ability to do excellent work.  His attendance issues affected so many aspects of his work here that it was difficult to see a consistent development.
Job Specific: Tyler does good work.  His best comes when given a "task" list where he will stay focused on the tasks until completed.  I want to see him succeed and be prepared to leave Berea fully prepared for a rich life and as a dedicated worker.   This has been a stressful year with many things given to me that has hindered me from spending as much time with my students as I would like.  The next year will be different in many ways and I expect to see great improvements with Tyler.

Attendance: Isaac demonstrated some attendance issues that I would like to see improve.  Some missed shifts and tardy situations only allowed Isaac to work 150.48 hours...just above the probation cutoff.  He was well below the expected 160 hours for each student in the program.  I would expect to see this improved moving forward.
Accountability: Attendance issues affected this somewhat.  Having said that, Isaac is accountable to his job and to the department and is diligent about his work.
Teamwork: Good team member.  No issues at all.
Initiative: Isaac is a self-starter and will often ask for items to work on and works until completion.
Respect: No issues here at all.
Learning: I think Isaac does well here.  The suggestion I would have for him would be to fully examine something to get a broad view of a concept/procedure etc. before beginning to work.  This will often clarify the intent, understand who this audience is, and perhaps the best way to communicate a process.  One recent example was the video project for CSO.  Although we were unable to use it because of CSO issues at their headquarters, it represented some good work.  I think had Isaac thought through the procedure and composed a complete script rather than a screen at a time, he would have gained a better understanding of the entire process and it may have prevented some of the adjustments needed to finalize the project.
Job Specific: I has the potential to do outstanding work.  He is articulate, intuitive, and thoughtful.  My regret was not being able to work with him as I would have liked due to to many administrative issues facing us with CSO and evaluations.

Attendance: Sam maintained very good attendance.  He was always on time for his scheduled tasks (which were primarily assisting with lab).
Accountability: Sam was very dependable. He showed up on time, did his job well, and graciously completed any tasks that I assigned.  
Teamwork: Sam works very well with others.  I observed no instances where Sam did not get along with fellow workers.  He is a great "team-player" and almost always displays a positive attitude.
Initiative: Sam does a great job taking his own initiative and completing tasks.  I never felt the need to micromanage him in his work.  He works diligently and is a very responsible young man.
Respect: Sam always shows respect for supervisors and coworkers alike.  I never observed him doing otherwise.  He is a respectful, professional employee.
Learning: Sam is very proactive in using his labor position as a learning experience.  He is very inquisitive and utilizes his position as an opportunity to increase his knowledge base. 
Job Specific: Sam is a trustworthy, dependable, hard-working teaching assistant.  He is a credit to our department and greatly strengthens our TA pool.

Teamwork: Sarah has improved in this area, but she still can show some improvement when it comes to working with others on a task. However, Sarah is excellent when it comes to working with students during tutoring hours.
Initiative: Sarah was able to run Tutoring seasons on Saturday afternoon by herself. In fact, she developed study questions to help students prepare for quizzes and exams. Many of these study questions are so good that they will be used in future semesters.
Respect:  
Learning: Sarah spent a significant amount of time reviewing class material so that she could be effective when helping students during tutoring hours.

Attendance:  
Accountability: Nick always completes his tasks and does a good job with all of them.
Teamwork: Nick is definitely a team player.  He shares his ideas and listens to those of others.  He is patient and works well with me, with his fellow TAs and with the students in our class.  
Initiative: Nick is very good about keeping up with his work and always completes what he sets out to do.  He worked on a long-term project throughout most of the term and kept that going without having to be reminded about it.  The only suggestion I have for him is to be willing to dig a bit deeper to find things to do or to find supplies in lab.  There have been times when he couldn't locate materials, when a bit more exploration would have uncovered them (e.g. lab supplies).  Similarly, Nick could suggest tasks that need to be done, rather than letting me suggest them.  This is Nick's first year as a TA, though, and I expect that he will get better with this as his confidence in the position grows.  Again, this is not problem, merely an area for growth.
Respect: Nick is patient and respectful with our students and with me (often the harder of the two to deal with...).  He will share his ideas, but also listens to others and considers their point of view.  He can disagree while still being respectful of others.
Learning: Nick and his colleagues have designed additions and improvements to some of our lab activities, giving me new ideas and helping our students learn the material.  He and the other TAs have put together review sessions for the students as well, sharing their knowledge and advice on exam preparation.  
Job Specific: Nick has done a fine job in his first year as a biology TA and I have thoroughly enjoyed working with him.  He has contributed to laboratory teaching and has helped me with a research project for a national organization.  He is responsible and a great colleague.  As Nick continues as a TA, I hope that he will demonstrate more confidence in his abilities and will be come more comfortable sharing his ideas with others, perhaps even to the level of teaching a lab session.

Attendance: Perfect attendance.
Accountability: Bryson manages his time very well and completes assignments in a timely manner.  He has been good at paying attention to details which is important in his position as a PAL leader.  As a PAL team we did a much better job on maintaining lab cleanliness during the spring semester.  We still need to work on maintaining the prep room regularly.
Teamwork: Bryson worked well with his other PAL leaders.  He listened to ideas from others as well as contributed his own to the group.  I am looking for Bryson to take on more of a leadership role next fall in helping to train the new PAL leader.
Initiative: Bryson certainly completes job assignments with little supervision.  I do not have to tell Bryson twice to get a job done.  I would like for Bryson to take more initiative in creating projects that can be used in future PAL sessions.
Respect: Bryson is very respectful and works well with others that may have very different views from his own.  He did have trouble being a role model student (was drowsy) on a few occasions in the 8am class.  I look for this to improve in the future.
Learning: Bryson is always willing to try new things in his PAL sessions.  He listens to and shares ideas with his co-PAL leaders.  I would like to see Bryson more engaged in labor meetings.
Job Specific: Bryson has been a great addition to the PAL team.  He has managed his time well between difficult pre-med courses of his own with his job as a PAL leader who is responsible for facilitating his own classes.  He will continue to work on being a role model student in the classroom and increase his leadership role in the fall term.

Accountability: Aubree is highly responsible and has a quick turn-around on any job assignments she gets.
Teamwork: Aubree collaborates with her fellow TAs in class, in lab, and during evening tutoring hours.  She and her partners have contributed greatly to our students' learning and to our shared work.
Initiative: Aubree frequently suggests tasks that she would like to take on, especially in relation to designing learning experiences for our students. She also is very good about asking if there are things she can do to take work off my plate (such as grading), which I appreciate very much.
Respect: Aubree works very well with our students, her fellow TAs, and with me. She seems to be getting more comfortable sharing her ideas and opinions, and is always considerate of other points of view without losing sight of her own. 
Learning: Aubree is considering a career in education, and she takes advantage of any opportunity to design an activity for class or lab or to otherwise explore the skills needed to be a teacher.  It has been exciting to see Aubree's enthusiasm and growing confidence in this area.
Job Specific: Aubree is highly responsible and epitomizes the TA skills and attitudes that work so well in our introductory Biology course.  I look forward to working with Aubree on higher-level courses as she moves up in our TA hierarchy.

Attendance: Corey was tardy a few times, but was more than willing to come in and help assist setting up the lab and lab exams even if he was not scheduled to do so.  He also has been willing to cover for other PAL team members when necessary.
Accountability: Corey completed job assignments in a timely manner.  We did better as a PAL team in maintaining lab cleanliness during this semester.  We still need to work on organizing the prep room regularly.  
Teamwork: Great team member.  I would like to see Corey volunteer to take on more responsibilities next year.  He does an excellent job sharing ideas and strategies with the other PAL leaders.
Initiative: Corey performs tasks well with little supervision.  I would like to see Corey volunteer for more responsibilities next year.  As a PAL team we are working on trying to take more initiative in creating projects.  Corey regularly and naturally seems to be able to come up with creative ideas that he shares with the group. 
Respect: Always
Learning: Corey is a Biology/Education major and thus his labor position as a PAL leader has direct benefits to him.  Corey regularly shares pedagogical ideas with his co-PAL leaders.  I hope that he takes more of a leadership role in helping to train new PAL leaders in the future.
Job Specific: Corey has been a great addition to the PAL team.  He is passionate about teaching and cares deeply about the students' success.  I will look forward to working with Corey in the fall term.

Attendance: Paola has missed a few labor meetings, but is otherwise responsible in terms of her work hours.
Accountability:  
Teamwork: Paola took on an important project related to a Biology Department self-study.  She was a great co-worker to have on this, and she was intellectually invested in the project and interested in the outcome.
Initiative: Paola was highly independent in her work on the Biology study, and was very good about coming up with strategies for analyzing and presenting data and in framing the questions we wanted to ask in the study.  When working on the study, she took great initiative.  There were other times, however, when I didn't see that level of initiative, and if there was not something immediate to work on, I am not sure what Paola did with her time.
Respect: Paola seems to work well with her fellow TAs and certainly works well with me.  She is comfortable sharing her ideas and listens to others as well.  
Learning: Paola took on a great deal of responsibility when she agreed to work with me on the Biology study.  She was eager to learn about the questions we were asking and to look more deeply into the science of learning and ways to measure it.  Her insights were extremely helpful in carrying out and completing our study, and I would not have been able to do it so well without her.
Job Specific: Paola's class schedule made it impossible for her to work with us in class or lab, and so the bulk of her work this term was done on her own.  This called for a high degree of responsibility on her part, and gave her a different type of labor position than she had the term before, when she could work with students and professors in class and lab.  Paola's evening tutoring hours were rather late in the evening, and that was a further disadvantage in terms of interacting with our students.  But Paola's work on our Biology Department study was invaluable.

Attendance: Hsuan was always punctual
Accountability: Hsuan was absolutely stellar in this regard - this semester required an extraordinary amount of lab maintenance owing to the nature of the laboratories I was teaching.
Teamwork: Hsuan worked seamlessly with my other TA's.
Initiative: She is an exemplary self-starter in all that she undertakes.
Respect: Hsuan conducts herself in a professional manner in all that she undertakes.
Learning: Hsuan is one of the best laboratory assistants I have had at Berea in 27 years (and that is saying quite a bit as I have had some exemplary TA's).  She is knowledgeable about the subject being taught and even, on her own initiative, conducted effective review sessions with students in one of my courses this semester which were very well-received.
Job Specific: Hsuan completed all her labor requirements and more in an outstanding manner.

Teamwork: Chioma is a good team member and will be taking on more leadership responsibilities in the fall term.  
Initiative: The team is working on taking more initiative in creating projects.  Chioma is an extremely busy nursing major, but if time allows, I would like to see her try to initiate a project of her choosing that will help the students become more successful not only in A&P, but also beyond.  I am expecting Chioma to take more initiative in organizing the PAL leaders in the fall term as she takes on a greater leadership role.
Respect: Always.
Learning: Chioma has become more confident designing and facilitating her PAL sessions.  In the fall term, she will be taking her teaching to a new level as she helps to train the new PAL leader.
Job Specific: I can count on Chioma to do her job in a timely manner.  She works well in a team and understands the value of her position as a PAL leader and T.A.

Attendance: Jacquie is very punctual and always arrives for work on time. In the few instances where she had to be late to work, she always notified me in advance.  
Accountability: Jacquie does a good job in completing any assigned tasks in a timely manner.  She is very careful and meticulous in her work.  I can depend on Jacquie to complete any assignments and be confident that she will give them her best efforts.  She is extremely reliable and dependable.  
Teamwork: Jacquie is an excellent "team-player" and works very well with others.  She is able to interact and work successfully with the most trying and difficult peers.
Initiative: Jacquie is highly self-motivated and takes initiative in completing her work assignments.  I feel completely comfortable with giving her an assignment and "walking away", fully confident she will complete her tasks and complete them successfully with minimal guidance from me.  Jacquie is very independent and has a great ability to manage tasks on her own (utilizing minimal direct supervision from myself).
Respect: Jacquie is very respectful towards others, faculty and students alike.  She is very patient, kind, and willing to listen to others' points of view. 
Learning: Jacquie takes her job very seriously.  She is always exploring new ways in which she can grow academically through her labor position.  She is very forward-thinking and uses her position in very beneficial ways for personal and professional growth.  
Job Specific: Jacquie is an excellent teaching assistant.  I wish I could keep her as my teaching assistant for many, many years to come.  Alas, that is sadly not possible.

Teamwork: Christinia has been a co-teacher in our BIO 110 class, working well with me, our students, and her fellow TAs.

I would like to see her gain enough confidence to suggest ideas without waiting for me to ask her for them.  She needs no supervision, and is definitely a self-starter, so this would be next level of "initiative" for her.
Respect: Christinia listens to me and to our students and offers feedback.  She works well with other TAs as well.

She is a very good facilitator in our active-learning classroom and she is one of the go-to people for evening tutoring sessions.

40875: My only comment is about the point system that is being used in evaluations. I am not sure that supervisors should be told to grade most individuals with good standing within a number range that though supposedly positive, appears to be so low.

Attendance: Mr. Lewis' attendance has been a bit erratic this semester but I believe this to be a product of both his class load and participation in various musical/choral groups on campus.  He has by all accounts proven to be effective in his ability to manage the time requirements of all of these activities and for that I must commend him.  Seth and I have maintained an open dialogue of any possible schedule changes that were required to fulfill other obligations. Also, Mr. Lewis has been diligent in making sure he fulfills his contracted hours.
Accountability: Mr. Lewis has demonstrated an increasing amount of accountability  and I believe this growth will continue as he gains even more knowledge and experience.
Teamwork:  
Initiative:  
Respect:  
Learning: Mr. Lewis has shown a fair amount of aptitude for the work that we preform.  I have no doubts that he will continue to gain knowledge and understanding has he gains more experience.

Attendance: Malcolm has rarely missed a shift and has always communicated in advance of any instances of tardiness.
Accountability: Mr. Blowe seems to be a fairly accountable young man but with his limited experience/knowledge I've yet to give him much individual responsibility.  This isn't to say that I believe that I can't or shouldn't but rather the make-up of our workforce this semester hasn't provided the need/opportunity as of yet.
Teamwork: Malcolm has been an excellent team player and has interacted wonderfully with everyone in the department.
Initiative: Mr. Blowe does not appear to lack initiative. He has proven capable of working alone (and outside of regularly scheduled shifts) in a few instances this semester.

Attendance: Lance's attendance habits continue to be a area of disappointment for me.  His punctuality and communication are both lacking overall, while I have witnessed an uptick in both during recent weeks.
Accountability: To be fair I'm less than pleased with Lance's time management skills.  He seems to have a propensity for maintaining a level of efficiency that is just below average on the best of days.  Given that I know Mr. Shelton has a high level of intelligence and a few semesters experience in the program I expect more from him and that bias may be showing up in this review.
Teamwork: Lance works well with everyone on the team but is at his best when limited to working alone or with a single partner.
Initiative: This is an area that I hope to see Mr. Shelton to improve upon.  At this point in his tenure I would expect him to have shifted his thinking away from only finding/identifying an issue and more towards the process of how to overcome an issue when it arises. 
Respect: Lance is a very respectful individual.
Learning:  
Job Specific: Lance meets the most basic of his labor requirements and as such has much room to improve.  This improvement I feel is imperative for him to succeed after the completion of his education.

Attendance: Mr. Brown's attendance has been acceptable.  He has missed several shifts this semester but has only failed to give acceptable notice on a couple of occasions.  That being said Mr. Brown has made up for these deficiencies by being an active and willing participant in our student call back program. This program utilizes students to help with minor maintenance during regular non-business hours.
Accountability: Chad has really began to accept/assume more accountability and I will rely on him even more in the future.
Teamwork: Mr. Brown really does work well with everyone.
Initiative:  
Respect:  
Learning: Mr. Brown has assisted with the training of some of our newer members and has been of great help doing so.

Attendance: Mr. Hackney has excellent attendance habits..  He has also been a willing participant in our departments "call-back" program helping resolve minor maintenance issues during nights and weekends when full-time staff aren't on campus.
Accountability: Evan has earned my full trust as he has assumed the responsibility of a of a full-time staff member.  He not only completes work in a timely fashion but with the level of attention and detail that is rarely demonstrated by a student.
Teamwork: Evan seemlessly elevated himself to an unofficial leadership role very shortly after joining our department.  He did this by demonstrating great interpersonal skills and gaining the respect of each and every team member he worked with.
Initiative: Mr. Hackney quickly proved to me that his initiative would not be of concern.  He has so quickly assimilated to the group and the services that we provide, that I no longer focus any time or energy on him or the tasks that I assign to him.  I know that if he has any questions or concerns that he will bring them to me and this allows me to focus my energies on other areas.
Respect: As I've spoken to before, Evan handles himself in such a respectful manner that has gained the full respect of his peers and myself.  His example has helped set the standard for the rest of our department and is an example that will surely be missed in the coming semesters.
Learning: Mr. Hackney's aptitude and willingness to both learn and share are unparalleled within the student workforce in my opinion.
Job Specific: Mr. Hackney far exceeds the labor position that he was assigned to.  I feel both blessed that I've had an additional student supervisor, yet ashamed that he did not receive the official title or appropriate WLS designation.

Attendance: Due to the nature of her job, Morgan or "Mogo" made her own work schedule based upon the needs to the productions.  She was always onetime or early to appointments she set up with the actors

Respect: Mogo always demonstrated a high level of respect for the space and for those she worked with in the Theatre program.
Learning: Mogo was always willing to learn new techniques, as well as new materials. She also shared this knowledge with others.  She demonstrated of love for the area of makeup.

Attendance: Wherever Coralie works in the future, her employer will not have to worry over attendance. She is punctual and always willing to work extra hours if I need someone.
Accountability: I was off work for 3 weeks during this term. Coralie managed the office like a professional administrative assistant with several years of experience. She checked student work schedules and rearranged as needed. She sent out pertinent emails daily. The faculty reported that the office ran without a hitch while I was off. 
Teamwork: Coralie is the student manager over three other students in the office. She is well respected by them. She thinks of all kinds of things that promote a positive atmosphere in our workplace. She is the best student manager that I have had. 
Initiative: Coralie needs very little supervision. She is mature, trustworthy and a leader. She really cares if our office runs well or not. 
Respect: I will repeat what I said in other evaluations. Coralie has a tender, compassionate heart for all humanity. That shines through as students and faculty from many different countries and all walks of life come to our office for help.
Learning: As I have said on other evaluations, I wish I had kept a list of the many wonderful ideas Coralie came up with during her four years. Her ideas and suggestions contributed to the office operating on a higher level of excellence.
Job Specific: I hired Coralie her freshman year. She has stayed with me four years. Next year she will work one semester in the office and do student teaching her last semester. She will be greatly missed! She is one of the best student workers I have had in my 29 years with the College.

Attendance: Talha would fill the required absence forms and would regularly check his timesheet to make sure he is making up any of his missing hours. However, he gave short notice for his absence due to a conference and was late to few trainings and individual meetings. During our spring break service trip, Talha did not meet with the group at the assigned time for departure, this was also the case when we departed for the Hunger Hurts Food Drive, required Bonner event. Thus giving advanced notices of absences, is an area to improve upon, especially that being punctual affects the work of a team, and the communication with community partners.
Accountability: Talha ensures proper care of work equipment at CELTS and at the schools, and follows the dress code for Foley Middle School. Talha can improve on time management and task delegation when working on a team to complete a project; his group for the Service Learning Expo faced had a delay in completing their poster compared to the other groups. At Foley, Talha does a great job in helping the students stay on task, especially when he is in charge of a group who needs to retake an exam or catch up on course material.
Teamwork: Talha is a valuable addition to the classroom that he serves at, and has professionally improved in in his interactions with the teacher and the students in the classroom. He could improve on his collaboration with his fellow Bonner Scholars during trainings, an example is when his group for the Service Learning Project needed more proper communication and task delegation.
Initiative: Talha takes great initiatives in the classroom. Several times, he was asked by the teacher to demonstrate to the classroom al ternative methods to solve math problems. He also stepped up and led a classroom once when the teacher was absent and the substitute teacher was not as familiar with the material. Talha had room for stepping up more during our trainings in contribution to the discussions. 
Respect: Talha respectfully deals with differing points of view and exhibits professionalism in his interactions at Foley Middle School. During the Spring Break service trip, Talha’s comments towards the Bonner’s faculty associate and first-year coordinators conveyed a lack of respect to the main learning objectives of the service trip. His comment did not portray the adaptability that was required from the team as a whole during the service trip. When pointed out to him, he was willing to reflect on his comment and learn from it. Another area to improve upon would be avoiding short notices in case he cannot attend a(n individual) meeting, in order to leave room for his supervisor to provide an al ternative time for rescheduling. 
Learning: Talha asks very good questions during his individual meetings to ensure that he is reflecting on his work performance. He has grown in his service at the school throughout the year by receiving feedback on his performance from his labor supervisor and the teachers, and was responsible to constantly ask for such feedback. I would like to mention that Talha learns best when given one-on-one feedback, and that is when he demonstrated the willingness to discuss his work performance with his mentors and supervisors.
Job Specific: Talha fulfilled his labor requirements in his service at Foley Middle School and showed growth in professionalism throughout the year. At certain points of the semester, Talha had several outside of work and classroom commitments that his job as a First-Year Bonner Scholar diminished in priority level; especially that being a First-Year Bonner requires a commitment to service and reflection to ensure personal growth and service to others.

Attendance: Chase was frequently late or a no-show. I often telephoned or emailed her to see where she was and if she planned on working. She would generally tell me she was ill or overslept.       
Accountability: Chase completed most of her assigned tasks if left a list to follow.  She would not comply to the dress code set for the position. She would wear short shorts and bare midriffs were not appropriate apparel for Child and Family Studies. 
Teamwork: Chase is willing to do whatever is needed. She often completed tasks of her other teammates when they were unable due to an absence.  
Initiative: When she arrives, Chase goes directly to work.  However, she often would overlook some tasks.  She did not seem to be focused on the task at hand. 
Respect: For the mot part Chase is respectful of others but when challenged about her work she can be abrasive and emotional. 
Learning: While I had asked Chase to work closely with me in the office and would offer her some tasks that would have been interesting or a learning experience, her lack of dedication to the position made me resist giving her these kinds of tasks.  She was frequently late or absent and although she made up her time, I could not depend on her for the tasks.  
Job Specific: If not closely supervised, Chase does not demonstrate accountability to her position. She often arrives late, or not at all, and often does not tell me she is not coming to work.  She wears improper attire as set by the guidelines of this position. She does not seem to focus or be able to maintain general routines. Chase will do what she is asked, but does not demonstrate ownership or take pride in her work.  She does not feel accountable to the position, nor feel it necessary to tell me when she wants to go on break to smoke; she just leaves the building. Some may expect this sort of behavior from a freshmen until they receive direction; however, she did not behave this way her freshmen year.  She clearly did a good job then and this is why she was promoted to building monitor.  When I try to discuss office guidelines, she becomes highly emotional, crying and sometimes shouting at me.  When confronted about her absences or her work, she believes I am angry with her for no reason because I am understanding when she is ill.  She believes her work is a good as other students.  However, I remind her that she is held to a higher standard as a WSL4 position.  When confronted on an issue she believes I am singling her out. I am very concerned for this student's ability to focus, to discern critiquing from criticism, and her general understanding of work ethic.

Attendance: Adriana was a member of the basketball team which season runs nearly the entire year.  We knew of her dedication to sports when offering her the building monitor position. She made up her time lost to the season and gave me advance notice when she would have "away" games or pratices. 
Accountability: Adriana understands accountability and completed her tasks and often those of her teammates.
Teamwork: As a sports player, Adriana full understands the need for teamwork.  She often filled in for those of her teammates who could not or did not fully complete their assigned tasks. She complimented their work and sent thoughtful and constructive emails to encourage her teammates.  
Initiative: Adriana is a self starter and completed her tasks as assigned.  She demonstrated initiative by completing the work of others without being asked.  As she saw the need she completed the work. As for supervision, she needed some guidance. Because she was first to unlock in the mornings and often arrived before any staff, she would do her job and leave her position to eat breakfast while on the clock. She was reprimanded for this and complied. She sincerely did not see the harm until I shared with her how this looks to her teammates, how that it undermines the position, as well as does not honestly reflect her time. She apologized for this indiscretion and repaired her time.   
Respect: Adriana is very respectful and demonstrates this in her service to others.  her emails are professional and her guidance to the other students admirable. 
Learning: Adriana has learned the importance of leadership roles and their influence of others. Her correspondence is good and she shares her ideas well.  She is a bright young woman who adds to the life of others. 
Job Specific: Adriana does her job well and without much guidance.  She did have an instance where she abused her position by leaving the job to eat breakfast and confusing some of her labor hours. She had a friend who was entering time for her.  We had a conversation regarding such and I do believe that the outcome was good; Adriana knew she had made a huge mistake.  To quote her, “the biggest one I have made in my life.”  Knowing Adriana, and in regard for her future at Berea College, I decided to handle this “inhouse.” I told Adriana that I saw her as a strong, capable woman, and if I believed, for an instant, she would not learn from this or did not understand the consequences of her actions then I would have not hesitated to send this forward to the Labor Program. She did learn and made restitution for her time.  I am very proud of her...proud her strengths and her accomplishments. She will do well and be an asset in her next position.

Attendance: Riley has continued to have great attendance. Even with some medical issues that came up this semester, she is meeting her hourly requirements. When she was unable to work she always let us know and often arrived early for her shifts. 
Accountability:

Initiative: Riley has taken more initiative this semester and completes her routine tasks without needing reminders.
Respect: Riley is always respectful of everyone in our workplace. I can't think of even one example where she's offended someone. 
Learning: Riley really dug into our labor meetings this semester and participated alongside of staff.
Job Specific: Riley provides reliable and skilled support for the operations teams at MACED.

Attendance: Noel is very punctual and always arranges times that she needs to not be here. She also needs little help keeping track of her house and hardly ever forgets to clock in or out.
Accountability: Noelle does all these things.  She often does jump right into the work that she sees or knows is to be done.  I think if I had more time for training, she would be more like this.  If there is a deadline, she usually meets it.
Teamwork: Noelle seems to thrive on being around and working with other people and making the atmosphere friendly and positive. 
Initiative: This is true about 95 percent.  Sometimes she seems easily confused and unable to understand me--or finish a job until I lead her.  Perhaps this is as much my communications skills at the outset of a job, which I am working on, as it is her need to be reassured and get individual face-to-face direction. I think as she matures, she will trust her own judgment more.  She is definitely a self-starter when she is sure of the task she is embarking on. She adapts to change, but like other students we have had, would rather things go smoothly from beginning to end, with no surprises. Wouldn't we all, in that perfect world? 
Respect: Noelle is always respectful, and inclusive in her treatment of others.  For example, she wanted us to interview a certain student for a position here despite some visual and other obvious personality differences--give her a chance.  She is very sensitive to the needs of others who may not get their due notice because they are different.
Learning: Noelle does all of these things, and has quickly and aptly learned our Registration and invoice mechanisms.  She also has been a huge help in archiving more than 20 boxes for the Library Archive before our office move.  She has valued the skills she has learned here, but wanted to use her writing and editing abilities more than we could provide.  I was glad she found a job with the Learning Center to be working with students on their writing skills and I thing she will benefit much more there than here.  I also think that while she has been here she has gained more confidence in other ways about working in the workplace. She loves to share her knowledge about personality styles, books and help any way she can.
Job Specific: She has done this very well, at a higher level than her WLS reflects. She is accurate and exacting.  As a transfer and older student, this was a relatively easy position for her, and in future, we are going to challenge our students more and integrate them more into the program work as well as the administration, logistics jobs that everyone considers tiresome.

Attendance: Sunshine has done much better handling stress, and rolling with the punches of college life, the second term of her freshman year. A couple of times she has been sick, or overslept due to not feeling well. She never runs late getting to work when she is well. I have no complaints regarding her attendance. She is always willing to work extra if I need someone.
Accountability: Sunshine is a good worker. She does a quick turnaround on projects she is working on. For example, this morning a teacher dro pped off a few handwritten notes and asked if the scribbles could be typed up. Within a few minutes Sunshine emailed the notes to the teacher. The teacher emailed her back and said, "Lightning fast fingers." Sunshine has never broken cell phone policy or other rules that we have in place for the office.
Teamwork: Sunshine is a very pleasant young woman and always has a smile. She fits in well with the team of students in our office. She is well liked. As the year progressed, I think it became clear to Sunshine how this office supports the welfare of the whole campus and especially the 60+ faculty in our building. We do a lot of team exercises in labor meetings to show the importance of each link in a team, or how each team member may be looking at a situation from a different perspective.
Initiative: Sunshine is a self starter. She never needs to be told but once about what should or should not be done. I never feel the need to check on her to see if she is doing okay with a project. She usually finishes projects in record time.
Respect: As a labor supervisor, I instruct the students who work in the office to look up, make eye contact, and speak to people who come to our office, whether it is a faculty member bringing a project to do, or just someone stopping by to chat or get a piece of candy from our dish. Sunshine does a great job making everyone feel welcome and spreading "sunshine" into the lives of those on campus. I believe she is genuinely concerned with humanity--the lives of others.
Learning: I tell all incoming freshman to get up and follow me when I'm heading out of the office to trouble shoot (because I may forget to tell them to come with me). Sunshine has faithfully done that. On several occasions, I have been trouble shooting a knotty computer problem in a faculty office. When I turn around, I almost step on Sunshine because she followed me to the office (as instructed). Recently, I have just been sending Sunshine by herself. She has become a very good trouble shooter.
Job Specific: I am very happy that I hired Sunshine and that she is coming back to work for me next year! I'm very pleased with her work. She has been fully engaged and contributes positively to the group work done in the office. It will be fun to watch her grow next year as she learns more and more how to manage the office. I was off for surgery for three weeks this term. Sunshine carried her weight like a pro. She wrote down the two things that came up that she didn't have an answer. Neither were things that I would have expected her to know.

Job Specific: Kyaca is a driven young lady with responsibilities and duties that exceed the typical college student...even at Berea College.  Based on her ability to maintain a strong gpa while completing her labor assignments, Kyaca managed to balance school, work and family with the support of her follow classmates.  In time crunches, she was able to utilize the BCC as a space for her and her family.  This may have not been the easiest year for her but she now realizes that she is much stronger (physical and emotional) than she was at the beginning of the term.

Job Specific: Treasure has a number of assets that will benefit her in any labor position. And even though she has sought a new position next year that aligns with her career goals, she was a tremendous addition to our labor staff this term.  She was quick to support others and step up for assignments within the Center.  She understands the role of learning, labor and service and has excelled in all three areas.

Attendance: Alison (we call her that) is always punctual and doesn't miss work. She gives advance notices if she is going to be on a school trip or something else.
Accountability: Alison has never broken cell phone policy or other office rules that I can recall. We do a lot of scanning for teachers. Alison is very fast at it and does a good job. 
Teamwork: I'm scoring Alison as a 10 for several reasons. She is very quiet and it takes a while to get acquainted with her. However, she is a great asset to our team--always faithfully doing her part. She quietly does her work. She is very pleasant and always participants in whatever I have planned for labor meetings. She is well liked by her peers. 
Initiative: Alison never needs to be told but once to do a project. When she arrives for her shift, she clocks in and immediately starts doing the tasks that are required when first arriving (checking all of the printers in the building). If there is a project in the "to do" basket, she immediately picks it up and starts working on it. She  requires very little supervision.
Respect: Future supervisors will never need to worry about Alison in regard to interacting respectfully with all people. She has a great interest in humanity and the equality of all people. She exhibits that in our workplace.
Learning: Alison may not be as aggressive as some in figuring out all of the things that come up in the office, but I have no complaints. She pays close attention when things are being explained and usually does not have to be shown twice. 
Job Specific: Alison is a good worker, a pleasant person, and presents a positive attitude in the office. I am very happy she is coming back next year.

Attendance: I felt like there was no other rating I could give you except for the highest this year. You have consistently been here on time or before your shift starts. Except for that time we sent you home because you were sick, I cannot recall any other absences this semester. I've been really impressed by your punctuality. 
Accountability:  
Teamwork: You are consistently a smiling face and positive light in our office. You are always willing to pitch in. 
Initiative: This is one of the things I love about you. I appreciate that you complete a task and ask for what's next. I never have to wonder if you're actually working. This is an excellent example for you to set for our new students next year and will be an expectation as you take on more responsibilities. 
Respect: I believe you are respectful in most everything you do. However, you're as passionate about your opinions as I am. So as I've said to you before, always be conscientious in an office setting to conduct yourself professionally. We're a laid back office, but there are office settings that are not as comfortable as ours. I just want you to be prepared for that in the future.
Learning: I appreciate what you've done this year to help me get the process of Class Notes and Passages more streamline. I welcome your input and recognize your hard work to make sure things are accurate. Next year, I'd like to build on your knowledge, perfect some of the things we're already doing and get you to the point where you could practically do my job if I was not here as well as train new students.

Attendance: Tran is on time most of the time.  Rarely late, and has always notified me in advance of needing to divert from her schedule.
Accountability: Tran is excellent at managing her time and projects for work.  She helps me and others with remembering things like policies and procedures, and always takes excellent care of equipment, facilities, materials and work environment.
Teamwork: All semester Tran has demonstrated a willingness to help the other teams in our office and understanding of how her work impacts others.  In this is she is especially exemplary.  A specific project that comes to mind is that of a video she edited and arranged for an end of semester International Senior Recognition Reception.  She volunteered to help, and then made sure the videos were well-thought out and pleasant to view.  
Initiative: As part of Tran's willingness and ability to work with others, comes her sense of initiative.  She is more than capable of completing job assignments without need of constant supervision, but more importantly is a self-starter able to adjust and adapt to change as needed and seek out appropriate work to do or offer help when she sees others in need!
Respect: Tran is always professional in the work place to those she works with, people she encounters on the phone or visitors to the Center for International Education.  She is also excellent at dealing respectfully with conflict and differing points of view, as she offers reason and is not emotional when her opinion is different.  If she sees that the others' position has merit, she acknowledges it and is happy to understand better.
Learning: Tran is a constant learner and sharer of what she has gleaned to better her understanding and that of others.
Job Specific: Tran fulfills her job duties admirably, whether specified in her job description or as additional beyond what's written.

Initiative: Tessa is a fantastic self-starter, and finds work that needs doing, often without the need for constant supervision.
Respect: Tessa is a super-star in the area of respect.  She is very careful to show her respect for others to all she encounters, and is very capable of dealing with conflict and differing points of view in a respectful way.

Attendance: Any employer Zak may have in the future will never have to worry about him not showing up or being late for work. He is one of the most dependable workers (as a College student worker) that I have known.
Accountability: I will restate what I did the last time I evaluated Zak. If I could rank Zak higher than 100%, I would. He is a young man that can be totally trusted to do the right thing at all times. I was off work three weeks for surgery this term. I was very fortunate to have Zak as a worker. I knew the office was in good hands!
Teamwork: Zak is highly respected by the faculty we serve and by his co-workers. He is always upbeat and friendly. He never seems to have a bad day. He is very conscientious and mature for his age and always fully engaged.
Initiative: I can't recall ever needing to prompt Zak to begin work. If there is work in our "to do" basket, he begins working on it immediately upon arrival. If I tell him two or three things simultaneously, he never wavers, and gets all of it done if possible. I never have to look over his shoulder or remind him of what needs to be done. And, he completes tasks in record time.
Respect: I will repeat what I said in the fall. Zak has a respect for humanity which is extraordinary for a young College student. He is such an asset to this office that serves 60+ residents, coming from many different countries, and many different traditions and cultures. He is never without a smile.
Learning: If there is something that Zak doesn't know, he works until he figures it out especially regarding technology and media equipment. When faculty are experiencing a knotty computer problem, they call to ask if Zak is in!! Zak is also very attentive in labor meetings when I'm presenting something new or going over things that haven't worked well in the office. He is the type of person that will be a life long learner. 
Job Specific: Zak is finishing up his third year working in our office. I can't say it any better than I did on the last evaluation, so I will repeat it. What a gift Zak has been to me personally and to the faculty we serve and to the College as a whole. This place is better because of Zak's abilities, his great attitude and wonderful personality.

40875: Working in the draper office with Phyllis and the rest of the crew has been a great experience since I first started attending Berea. There is no other position I'd rather be in. The office teaches you so much that you can use in everyday life and while in school. I thank God everyday for putting me in Phyllis's hands while at Berea.

Attendance: Win has become increasingly unreliable in his attendance, including several incidents when he left to go to the CPO and returned over an hour later. Entire absences resulted in me emailing him, inquiring where he was and asking if everything is OK. He would then return the email to apologize and provide reasons for his absence. Win and I have talked about some personal issues going on that have had some negative impact on him, but he has also been provided several verbal warnings about his disappearances.  
Accountability: With the exception of the absences and disappearances, Win is usually on task. 
Teamwork: In all situations, Win is very respectful to everyone. 
Initiative: There may be times when Win is provided some additional guidance because it's his first time completing the task or a language barrier may be present, but overall, Win is quick to understand a task and will see to its completion. He's usually very fast!
Respect: Win is very respectful to everyone in the office and any visitors we might have. He often smiles and waves when he greets others for the day. In conversations during Labor Meetings, if he provides his own view, it is always provided with reason and never with judgment of others. 
Learning: Win seems to have a thirst for new knowledge, skills and experience. 
Job Specific: Basic labor requirements are fulfilled.

40875: I thank Sheri very much for her understanding. If I were with another supervisor, I would have been put on probation. I have worked out with Counselling Services and now understand the root causes of what might have been causing the problems all along. Now, over the summer, I am working on taking personal responsibility and accountability rather than giving excuses for failure to adhere job requirements. The experience and feedback in this semester are invaluable for my career. I thank everyone involved for their patience, understanding and compassion.

She is simply exceptional in every capacity I've known her in, and those who have the opportunity to work with her are very, very fortunate. She's just one of those people with a rare mix of talent, brilliance, kindness, humility, and exceptional people skills that make here a complete joy to work with.

Attendance: Tyller was present for her shifts and arrived on time.
Accountability: Tylle managed her time well and provided timely completion of job assignments. Workplace policies and procedures as outlined in the CTL Contract were followed for the most part. Respect for others will be discussed in later sections of this evaluation.
Teamwork: Tyller has had significant problems with her collaborative process and promotion of a positive workplace for all people. While she has done solid work as a consultant, her primary position as an assistant student manager has suffered greatly in Spring 2016 semester due to her unwillingness to take criticism and creation of a hostile work environment in the CTL with her peers and with the professional staff. Per her job description, these aspects were either not met or need significant improvement: 1. Communicate professionally and effectively via email or verbally with professors, staff, and students; 2. Mentor and help train intro, mid, and senior level consultants.  See Job Specific comments for more detailed information on reasons for this score.
Initiative: Tyller completed assignments as needed. 
Respect: Tyller worked well with students in her labor position. She had solid feedback from students. It is important to mention that two comments in our student survey feedback results that named Tyller as their consultant were actually test comments and were creat ed by an office assistant to test changes to our system. Those comments were: "Tyller is a dork and needs to take care of herself because we love her and would like her to not die" and  "Tyller was fantastic, effectively addressing all of my concerns for my paper without judgement or criticism. She was more than willing to share her resources with me, and gave me tools to continue work on my own."However, her lack in professional conduct in the workplace in how she talks to her peers  and how she refuses to work through criticism of her behavior in a professional and reflective manner is a significant reason for her low scores in this area. She does not deal well with conflict and refuses to entertain that she needs to work on the way she talks to people even after multiple complaints from per peers and from staff, including her supervisor. She does not respect the critical feedback given to her by her supervisor and instead of working on these issues sought to find out what peers and professional staff had filed complaints with her supervisor. This lack of respect and unprofessional behavior was further noted after the the directors of Career Development and Internships  reported that she was in the office after closing one evening and started asking them questions about whether or not they were the ones who reported her behavioral issues to her labor supervisor. For the latter part of the semester, Tyller's disrespect  and behavioral issues creat ed and uncomfortable working environment. So much so that Labor decided it was in everyone's best interest to remove her from the position as long as she had all her hours. Even with this decision made, Tyller still refused to respect authority figures, this time the director of the CTL who told Tyller to remand her CTL key to her labor supervisor immediately, which Tyller did not do until Labor was once again involved. 
Learning: Tyller has expressed interest in working with STEM projects. She has also shared knowledge with her co-workers, which is part of her job as manager - mentoring. However, she needs to work on her ability to lead as opposed to boss people. Doing projects for her peers instead of mentoring them in how they can do it themselves is not necessarily sharing knowledge. In fact, this is micro-managing, which does not promote successful development and leadership potential. This was part of the criticism from her peers, and she was unable and/or unwilling to reflect and understand the value of her job and how it related to her personal development. See Job Specific for more information on this score. 
Job Specific: Below is a timeline reflective of the escalating behavioral issues. This timeline is justification for Tyller’s labor evaluation score of “Needs Improvement.”Week of February 22 – Talked with professional staff member who expressed concerns regarding two of my students. Concerns were that Tyller was being short with them when discussing work projects. Concerns expressed were about her tone, which was described as being short and biting. Monday, February 29 – Mid Term Review –I asked these questions because I had heard from a professional staff member that two of my students had expressed concerns that she was more concerned with them making mistakes and the work not being perfect than actually mentoring them in their work. I told her I was investigating this further during mid-term reviews with all the students. Week of March 3 -14 -  Multiple reports from professional staff and student staff regarding Tyller’s tone and behavior in the center.  Tuesday, March 15 – At Labor Meeting, Tyller responded to three students with sharp biting tone. This was the first time I witnessed this first hand, and did not call her out in the meeting. Intent was to talk with her at her manager interview the next day.  Wednesday, March 16 – Tyller’s manager interview – interview turned into a meeting about her tone and behavior because that was of foremost concern. I told her that I had seen it myself at Labor Meeting. She said that she had been working with these students for 9 months now, so they should understand that is how she is. I said work is different than personal life, and regardless if she is working with her friends, she needs to think about how she is perceived by others. She said it was not her problem, it was everyone else’s problem. I said that was not an acceptable reason. She got upset and said she did not want to work here anymore, that she did not feel comfortable here. I asked her to elaborate. Instead, she got up and ran out of the meeting. The meeting lasted 15 minutes. Thursday, March 17 – I scheduled a meeting with Tyller during her administrative hours to continue the discussion she cut short the day before. We went outside to get out of the CTL. She said she was the “CTL punching bag,” and that she felt everyone was against her. I told her that if she thought she was the CTL punching bag, she needed to get out of the way of the punches, and that is where I came in, to help her figure out how to do that. She kept coming back to how she needed specific examples. I said the specific examples I was giving her was of her tone and how multiple people had expressed concerns. It was not her language, but the tone. She said that was not good enough. I even modeled her tone from the labor meeting, and she laughed at me, saying that she did not believe me, that it was not true. She said that she did her job, and that she was good at it, so that was not the case. I said you are good at part of your job, but a big part of management is working with peers, and that needed work. She again said she could not fix a problem if she did not have specifics. The conversation was going nowhere, and she was clearly not receptive to even considering fault, or at the very least reflecting on it. Made decision to write up Tyller for her behavior due to her inability to even consider that her behavior was problematic was unacceptable, as well as her disrespect toward he labor supervisor. Wednesday, March 23 – Write Up Meeting - Lisa Ladanyi is present as third party at Tyller’s request. During this meeting Tyller is still unwilling to consider that her behavior was problematic. At the end of the meeting, Tyller pulled out a tape recorder and said she had taped the whole conversation. I asked why she did that, and she said “to get specifics that you were not giving me.” I asked if this was her idea or someone else’s, and she said it was her idea. Lisa said that while this may be true, it was unprofessional, and she should always ask permission. I agreed with Lisa. April 5 – Dismissal from Labor PositionMultiple problems arose after Tyller was written up for her behavior. She apparently did not take or understand our recommendations about communicating with her peers. Instead of talking to them about letting her know if her tone was problematic, she apparently went to them and tried to figure out whether or not they had reported her behavior. Not only did this happen with her peers, but professional staff, as well. This made for a very uncomfortable, if not hostile, working environment for professional staff and students and multiple complaints were reported.  Her behavior was also a direct violation of the CTL Student Contract “Teamwork and Self Respect” clause: “Treat everyone in a friendly and respectful manner. Cooperate with students, staff, faculty, employers, and all other guests visiting the CTL. You are also expected to treat each other, and the students you serve with respect, and be accountable for doing your very best work with consultations, workshops, and any other projects you are responsible for as part of your labor position.” Because of these continued problems, we decided to once again escalate these behavioral issues to Labor, and the decision was made by Labor to remove her from her labor position as she had already met her labor contract. Final NotesIt is disheartening to see a student like Tyller crumble under the pressure of conflict and criticism. I would not have urged her to take on a management position if I did not think that she had the wherewithal to rise to the challenge. While she was a great consultant, her primary work was management, which included mentoring and modeling professional behavior. It became clear in the second part of the Spring 2016 semester that she was not ready for the challenge of management and needed remediation. It is disappointing that she lacked the maturity to see this clearly. It is even more unacceptable in the way she responded to the feedback, as if she was being victimized and given no support. This response includes a Facebook post on Tyller’s Facebook page about Writing Resources and her labor supervisor posted around April 11. The post was considered by the reporting body to be “mildly threatening” in nature, and a screenshot was sent to administration.  If she was being mistreated by Writing Resources, then she would have never become a manager. She would have never been asked to take on the virtual writing consultation pilot project. She would have not been funded to participated in professional development opportunities. During our trip to Columbus, GA, for a writing center conference in February 2016, I stopped twice for her to see her mother in Chattanooga since it was on the way, both ways. Months earlier I gave her my old iPhone to keep when her cell phone died and she could not call her mom. This is hardly a lack of support for this student.   This behavior towards her peers, her labor supervisor, and the other professional staff is reflective of a lack of maturity and will not be tolerated in the professional world outside of Berea. Since the labor program is educational in nature, it is important that Tyller be educated that these behavioral issues and lack of respect for her peers and administrators has consequences. Conflict is difficult, and no one likes to be reprimanded especially if they think they have done nothing wrong. The ability to respectfully consider critical feedback will be skills that she will need going forward in all aspects of her life.

Attendance: The rating is self-explanatory. 
Accountability: This term Renessa completed all of her assignments in a timely manner. 
Teamwork: In three years, there was never a problem with Renessa and her working relationship with other individuals interested in AFR. She has been the face of the program and fully accepted what this meant.
Initiative: Renessa had to be a self-starter because I tend not to hire students who need constant supervision. She fully understood what was expected of her and she performed the tasks in a professional manner.
Respect: Renessa is extremely respectful! In fact,she carries herself in a professional manner. No matter what is occurring in her life, Renessa finds a way to have a smile on her face.
Learning: The best example of growth for Renessa involves public speaking. She dislikes speaking in a formal setting. This year, she introduced all of the speakers for Kula Kusoma. Despite her hesitancy, Renessa's introductions were very good. She provided the appropriate information in a professional manner.
Job Specific: Although I would make jokes about her job performance, having Renessa as the Program Associate helped make my life easier over the past three years. She will be difficult to replace.

Attendance: Natalie is so punctual and has great attendance.  She does forget to clock in or out every now and then, but I don't she has any absences to give notice about.  If she has, she promptly makes up the time.
Accountability: Natalie does all these things, and often has completed a task before I even know she has started.  She is very quiet, but very effective and interested in her work. 
Teamwork: Natalie is willing to take on new work and in fact asked for more responsibilities early in the year.  Do to my busy-ness, I didn't see the deadline to raise her pay level, and I would have mid-semester but for that. She seems appreciative of the office environment (if a little bored sometimes) here and sees it relating to her future life as a business/farmer.  She asked for more financial duties, and we have given her management of Flex-E-Grant files, spreadsheet making and communications with FEG recipients in Eastern Kentucky.  She is getting down our accounting filing system, but sometimes doesn't look up directions in the student manual before asking questions.  She usually knows the answer, but our system is confusing and it took me a long time to memorize all the rules and exceptions to rules. She is concerned about accuracy and getting the job done.  Sometimes I feel like she likes to work solo, but she does work well with our staff and other student when given the change.  She is pretty quiet most of the time, but her quite demeanor does not mean she doesn't understand what is going on or that she is not interested in others. 
Initiative: As I said earlier, she does complete assignments, if the directions have been clear, and doesn't have to have constant supervision.  Adapting to change might be a little hard for her, but she always rolls with the tides and has faith that things will come out right.
Respect: Natalie is professional and respectful with all, but perhaps could work on being more inclusive and "friendly" as well as just considering the task at hand.  As my own supervisor recently told me, "It's not about just getting the job done--it is about building relationships." My impression is that she tends to stay out of any discussions that might be headed towards conflict or differing points of view, but maybe it is just her quiet nature that is at work here.  
Learning: I think she reflects a lot on how this job may help her in the future, as exhibited by her asking for more financial work.  She has used her experience here to help her get internships and has scored a good one working with farmers at a food HUB in North Carolina, her home.  She is very interested in learning new skills and is not afraid to ask for help or say she doesn't know how to do something.  And at the same time, she is quite nice about showing others how to do a task.
Job Specific: Natalie has fulfilled all the requirements of her job at the WLS level she is working and should be able to take on more complex tasks next year with finances and AI invoicing and registration.  We will have new student begin this summer and she will continue her training when Natalie returns in the Fall as the senior student. One of her tasks will be to become more skilled at the accounting system, green sheets and filing procedures as well.

Attendance: Kristina is very professional when it comes to attendance. She consistently provided me with advance notices of conflicts when appropriate.
Accountability: Kristina really exceeded my expectations here give that this was her first year at Berea learning to juggle academics with labor. She did an outstanding job completing job assignments on time and with high quality.
Teamwork: Kristina is a definite team player - always willing to collaborate with me and her team.  In her role as our communications and marketing staff, she had to collaborate on some level with almost everyone in the office all year long.  She did so like a seasoned pro.
Initiative: Again, Kristina really impressed me with her initiative.  She could spot opportunities, bring them to the table, and implement them with a maturity beyond her years.
Respect: Kristina is very respectful of all people, extremely professional, and kind.  
Learning: There was not a single task that I asked Kristina to do where she didn't jump in with both feet!  Whatever software tool she needed to get the job done, if she didn't have experience with it, she tackled it like a pro.
Job Specific: Kristina was a joy to work with. She exceeded my expectations in her work ethic, talent, professionalism, and quality of work given this was her first year at Berea.  I am extremely impressed.  She's a rising superstar.

He steps up to help with the office has events outside of normal work hours, and is very service oriented to his fellow team mates, Or internal "clients" as we refer to the coordinators he is designing work for and with.
Initiative:  
Respect: This is another area where Alejandro excels. He is extremely kind and respectful to everyone I saw him interact with, including me.
Learning: Alejandro has a natural curiosity, and with his outgoing nature, really lights up a room when he talks about ideas for future initiatives. He never shyed away from learning anything new.
Job Specific: I am pleased to say that by the end of his first year at Berea, Alejandro evolved tremendously in his labor position.  He came to us with innate creative ability, and now with a year of labor experience in an team office environment with attendance and project completion expectations, I look forward to next year where I think he'll be able to contribute volumes from day one of the new semester.

Attendance: Dzhoana has a secondary position in this office but has shown good promise in sticking to her schedule. When working in a primary position she will need to be sure to notify me if she needs to miss her scheduled hours in the office. 
Accountability: Dzhoana is learning about maintaining a neat work space that is shared with other workers. My expectation is that when she works in a primary position she will feel more ownership for the office and its routine tasks. 
Teamwork: Dzhoana has worked less hours than her colleagues, but shows evidence of cooperation and the ability to learn from others to accomplish the complex work of this office. She is also just learning about the other supervisors in the office, and will continue to gain confidence after becoming a primary worker. 
Initiative: I expect that Dzhoana will be more of a self-starter when she assumes a primary position in this office. She shows that she can work well on a project with minimal supervision. She has show great flexibility in all the small tasks assigned to her this year.
Respect: Dzhoana is a quiet presence in the office, but spending more hours here will help her feel more comfortable with all the administrators. She is respectful of those who she works with and I expect her to grow in her confidence as she learns more about the other staff members and her role in the office as a primary worker.
Learning: Dzhoana has not been able to participate in the Tech Tips learning to the extent I would like this year, again due to her limited hours in the office. I hope to see her gain in skills as she expands to a primary role. 
Job Specific: Dzhoana has done a great job in this office as a secondary worker and I have expectations that her importance will increase with her assuming a greater role. I see promise and that is why I have offered her a primary position, and I look forward to working with her this summer.

Attendance: Dorian is punctual for his work schedule.  He also gives advance notice of his absence.  He does rearrange his schedule and not come in to work on a regular basis. This poses a problem for other aspects of this evaluation as he can not excel in other areas when I can not rely on his attendance. 
Accountability: Dorian is conscious of his assignments and does his work well.  He takes care of the equipment, facilities, materials and work environment.  He is not always at work and thus can not be considered completely accountable. 
Teamwork: Dorian is not always present for work thus he does not show understanding of how his work relates to others in the department.  He is willing to do anything asked while at work and I appreciate his ability to collaborate with others. 
Initiative: Dorian completes his assignments when he reports to work.  He goes to work immediately and does what he understands needs to be done.  His attendance does require supervision which takes away from my job but once on the job I can rely on him to complete the job to a high standard. 
Respect: Dorian shows respect to others.  He is very responsive to feedback and is very amiable.  Although, when he is not at work he shows some degree of disrespect to those he serves and others on the team. 
Learning: Dorian is quiet in group settings and does not offer his knowledge. One on one he is extremely interested in doing his job well and asks many questions to clarify expectations.  The standard to which he cleans shows he understands the value of his job. When he does not come to work it reflects poorly on that understanding.  There seems to be a disconnect between the importance of his role on a daily basis. 
Job Specific: Dorian meets all his job requirements when he is at work.  He has struggled to fulfull the basic labor contract but has managed to pull through.  He is tenacious and does not give up so I see great potential in his personal development over the next 3 years in relation to his labor requirements.

Attendance: Abby was punctual this semester, just like every semester. She has always taken her attendance seriously.
Accountability: Not only did Abby do a wonderful job of meeting the deadlines and expectations she had established for herself as Editor of Bereapedia, but she also managed to keep three writers (both students and staff) on point as well.
Teamwork: I routinely ask my most experienced student workers to mentor their younger peers by leading workshops on pragmatic topics which intersect their work and studies and Abby has been the only student to show any genuine interest in the program. She has lead team workshops on topics like: using Zotero citation management service; using microfiche and microfilm to locate newspaper articles; and the process of applying for (and funding) study abroad. Her commitment to supporting and building up her peers makes her an invaluable member of our team.

Respect: Moondil welcomes all everyone with the same welcoming smile and friendly greeting.

Attendance: Marshayla has had great attendance this semester and always arrives to work on time.  For the few times that she was not been able to work her scheduled shift, she always gave advance notice. 
Accountability:  
Teamwork:  
Initiative: Marshayla is an excellent self-starter and always completes her job assignments in a timely manner.  One way that she consistently shows initiative is by making sure the emails that are received in the Campus Visits email account are taken care of in a timely manner. In addition, Marshayla always comes in for her shift ready to work, which I really appreciate.
Respect:  
Learning:  
Job Specific: Marshayla has most definitely fulfilled the basic labor requirements and objectives of her position.  She knows her job well and the other reservationists often look to her for answers when they have questions.  She is truly an asset to our team and our office.

Learning: Katherine joined the Campus Visits team toward the end of the fall semester and was able to very quickly learn the reservationist duties and responsibilities.

Attendance: This was often an area of concern for Kerry.  On a few occasions, he needed a replacement for evenign duty with little to no advance notice.  
Accountability: On a few occasions, Kerry was found to be in violation of minor hall policies, sometimes well after the situation could be managed.  He failed to report a security issue with his keys until hall closing.  However, he did manage a semester-long entertainment program for residents, and was consistent in that.
Teamwork: Kerry was generally supportive of the team as a whole, but sometimes inadvertently showed disrespect to the team by being less than reliable for some duties.
Initiative: Most of the time, Kerry did his main tasks okay.  However, there were some critical elements (lack of notice of failure to attend duty, for example) that make it seem that he was not always 100% into the job or the work details involved.
Respect: Kerry was generally very open to discussing varying points of view with teammates and other students.  In the fall, he helped on a number of Fresh Start programs and offered a perspective that other students had not encountered.
Learning: At times, Kerry was so focused on personal and interpersonal relationship issues that it was difficult for him to devote himself to learning how to improve his performance.  He was generally receptive to directives, though, as would do as he was asked.
Job Specific: With less focus on distractions, I have no doubt Kerry's performance would have been noticeably stronger.  As a result, his evaluation is restricted to being somewhat average, a mix of high points with some serious low points.

Attendance: Kyle has shown strength in this area throughout the year, often covering for evening duty when others had last-minute changes in availability.
Accountability: Kyle is a strong and reliable worker in the department.  He follows procedure well, and asks questions when he does not understand protocol.
Teamwork: Kyle, as a teammate, is a lot of fun to have around as an employee.  He is witty and intelligent, and is always open to discussions from varying points of view.
Initiative: Kyle seldom needs to be told how to do his job.  He could improve in this area by taking charge of more programming tasks in the hall.
Respect: When Kyle disagrees with someone, he calmly states his reasoning, and allows for the open exchange of ideas.  His welcoming nature in this regard helps teammates and residents open that dialogue, and this is most appreciated.
Learning: Kyle is always interested in learning, whether in the classroom, on social media, or in his labor position.  While he has accepted a position in another department next year, his enthusiasm for learning will propel him to excellence.
Job Specific: Kyle has been a solid RA for the year.  I feel the position was not exactly what he expected, but he performed well in its capacity.  I feel he'll continue to do well in his next position.

Attendance: Corey had a few issues this semester with being on time for his responsibilities but once it was addressed he got everything under control. I believe he will continue to find balance with his responsibilities.
Accountability: Corey did much better in this area as the semester progressed. He has the ability to really do great work but sometimes struggles with time management. He did great work dealing with policies and procedures and worked very well with those.
Teamwork: Corey is a good team member and always has a positive attitude and friendly disposition. He is truly supportive and is willing to step up when needed.
Initiative: Corey does his job at a good standard but needs to look for more opportunities to infuse his personality with his job. I would like to see him get more personal with his programming which will help his creat e better residence atmospheres for his residents.
Respect: Awesome guy and great character. He communicates both verbally and written very professionally and efficiently.
Learning: In his first year as an Resident Advisor Corey has come to have a good grasp on his job and responsibilities. He definitely understands the value of his role and why he needs to work at a high quality standard.
Job Specific: Very solid year and definitely gets the basic labor requirements done. Next year he will return as a Resident Advisor and help open up Bingham Hall.

Attendance: Michael has made great strides in improving on his attendance. this semester he has shown major growth and continues to improve.
Accountability: Michael has improved from our mid year evaluation. He has clearly become more comfortable with his schedule and the work that needs to get done. I look for him to get even more precise as he returns as a senior RA next year.
Teamwork: Always a great attitude and spirit about him, which makes in the ideal team member. Michael can definitely still lead his team more when needed but he is always positive and willing to help with anything.
Initiative: As he ha sbecome more comfortable within his role I have seen his tasks completed on time without supervision. I strongly believe he will find even more ways to increase his effectiveness on the job in the future.
Respect: One of the calmest and most down to earth people I have been around or had an opportunity to work with. Michael is loved by pretty much everyone mainly due to his attitude and ability to make people feel calm and relaxed. 
Learning: Michael continues to learn and leverage his knowledge in many ways. I believe he demonstrates great understanding within the job and now just needs to start using his voice more to creat e more impact.
Job Specific: Michael has improved significantly in the basic labor requirements. he has improved his hours as well as the tass he is assigned. I will look for him to continue growing in this area.

Attendance: We have had some concerns for presence and punctuality. Jalen provided very late notice of absences and would not communicate all tardies. However, he was present at almost all programs regardless of whether he was hosting the program.
Accountability: We have had concerns over administrative work, such as completing duty logs and following-up with these types of aspects of the job. He did host a program, but the follow-through  was lacking--I.e. Fire pits, fliers. We encourage Jalen to find an organization system that works for him so that he can be more effective in his role. Jalen doe shave very good interactions with the team and residents. 
Teamwork: Jalen is a good team player and works well with others. Always willing to help in the moment, engaged once present, and is the only person who helped with Briittany's program.
Initiative: Jalen has been more consistent with bulletin boards and resident engagement. He was helpful in addressing a difficult situation on the floor. Jalen still required prompting and reminders for administrative tasks (putting hours in on time, duty logs), and being on time. 
Respect: Always respectful in his interactions. 
Learning: Has worked well with feedback and has gotten better with communication and has improved quality of fliers and bulletin boards.

Accountability: Caitlin had challenges to find what drives her and how to get the most out of her role to push herself as a leader.

Attendance: Sam did a great job and attended to work as expected.  There were only a few times he had to miss, and he arranged for substitution and volunteered for others when he could.
Accountability: Throughout the year, communication with residents was a task delegated to Sam, and he always did a great job with sending clear directives to residents.  This was above and beyond the normal expected call, and he really excelled at it.
Teamwork: Sam is very thoughtful and understanding, generally preferring to listen and understand, rather than just hear in preparation to respond.  He's a strong, silent leader who invites communication.  This contribute greatly to his teamwork.
Initiative: Sam needs little guidance or direction to do his work.  He is committed to doing what is expected, and often takes on more when he can.  He is able to manage his time very well, and always seems to be able to "pencil in" time for additional tasks when needed.
Respect: Sam can always be counted upon to address and communicate with others with respect.  Even when he has to deliver a less-than-pleasant message to residents, he does so very professionally, with an encouraging tone.
Learning: Sam is always very attentive to learning opportunities, both within and beyond our department.  He took on a secondary labor position as a TA this year, and balanced that with a heavy class load and extracurricular activities.
Job Specific: If Sam applied to work in the department, I'd snag him up in a heartbeat.  He's a valuable member of any team in which he works, and his next labor department will be lucky to have him.

Attendance: Justin is on time and present for all staff meetings, labor meetings and Deep Green programs. 
Accountability: : Justin supported students well in specific scenarios (such as a sexual harassment case) and represented Student Life well with a Title IX investigation. While Justin was encouraged to, he did not complete a program himself or fully support a program this semester (for instance, game night). We appreciate his willingness to serve Deep Green as an EcoChallenge representative and always support his team with programming initiatives. We encourage Justin to be more discrete with confidential information and approach to situations. 
Teamwork: Justin is a team player and participates in programs and is always very appreciate for things people do for him. Would like to see more initiative with his personal programming initiatives. We also appreciate his support with House Council funding, participation in ground level events, and support during Student Life recruitment and interviewing processes. 
Initiative: Justin helped out with others’ programming but did not take the lead on a program (an area for improvement last semester). He provided very good support for his teammates and challenged his residential floor with cleaning concerns. We never had to tell him to complete an assignment twice and he always followed-up as asked. 
Respect: Justin strives to be respectful of others and promote healthy community on his floor. While Justin is respectful in most of his interactions and dealings with others, we encourage him to work on approach to intense conflict situations with a more level head. 
Learning:  
Job Specific: Completes the requirements of the job.

Attendance: Renesha was on time, engaged, and contributed greatly to practically EVERY meeting, program, and departmental event this semester.  She has been heavily engaged the entire year.
Accountability: I have been amazed at the level to which I and my team has been able to rely on Renesha. She has a firm grasp on the philosophy of what we do and how it plays out in practical application. She truly understands how to be student-centered.
Teamwork: Again, Renesha has come through time and time again. She works incredibly hard and does a lot of heavy lifting on our team. Her presence has been invaluable this year as our staff has gone through numerous transitions. She has been a rock through it all.
Initiative: Next year I hope to see Renesha take on more of a leadership role on the team as a veteran RA. She did so much work this year but it was from the angle of a supporter/follower. This is great, but she has potential to be an impactful leader as well.
Respect: This is the only area where Renesha has had a few hiccups. Sometimes she can become defensive and less than respectful when she feels she is being unfairly treated or being given less than positive feedback. We have had talks about this and she has matured as an individual and as a professional this year.
Learning:  
Job Specific: She does amazing work and has fun while doing it. I appreciate her sense of humor and can-do attitude.

Attendance: Daniel is typically present and on time; although he has missed some meetings/events for classes, he provides notice to Savannah or Amanda. 
Accountability: Daniel is consistent with completing duty logs on time and completes tasks as assigned. Completes assignments in and turned in on time. He has strong administrative skills. We would like to have seen more resident engagement and interaction outside of structured team times. Daniel is a very hard worker when he is on shift—we truly appreciated his help with move-out duties. 
Teamwork: While Daniel is present and completes task-oriented assignments in program preparation, he does not actively engage or contribute in staff meetings or events. We would love to hear more feedback from Daniel and see more collaboration with events. However, Daniel does seem to have very positive interactions with his team members and good attitude.   
Initiative: Gets assignments done when asked but does not start things himself. Should complete bulletin boards successfully without prompting.
Respect:  
Learning: While improvements have been made with bulletin board and administrative tasks, he seems more isolated on staff and in the hall—we would like for Daniel to provide more input and actively engage others on the team and in the hall. 
Job Specific: People can recognize him as an RA and come to him for problems. Outside of what he is asked to do, he does not seem to engage residents or community. He was encouraged to seek opportunities for more hours in his primary position—most of his labor hours came from structured meetings and times.

Attendance: Lazim attends to his duties as expected, and notifies if he is unable to work for some reason.
Accountability: Lazim usually performs his work okay; however, it became known that he had violated a campus conduct policy, which required his release from his position.
Teamwork: Lazim adds real heart to the team, willing to help residents as much as he can.  A valuable team member, up until the circumstances leading to his release.
Initiative: Lazim was a mid-year addition to the team, and was really just getting the hang of the position.  It is difficult to assess how much personal initiative he had for the position, given the limited time of service.
Respect: Lazim showed great interest in learning about different peoples' points of view.  He interacted respectfully with his co-workers and supervisors.
Learning: Lazim showed great interest in the workings of the department; he knew this to be essential as a mid-year hire with less formal training.  
Job Specific: Lazim, in his time of service, had a lot of potential to be a great Resident Advisor.  However, he made a poor decision that violated campus policies, and this led to his release.  Were it not for that one terrible decision, his evaluation score would be much higher, and his potential would have led to a brighter future in the department.

Attendance: There was a period where there was no duty night for about three weeks due to many changes.
Accountability: There is accountability towards the job, but greater balance of self care and job obligations could improve performance and this score. Still some disconnect between outside clubs and work.

Initiative: Gabby completes tasks that need to be done without being asked and can be relied on for completion of tasks.
Respect: Boundaries are crossed as it relates to position/roles. Effort placed on respecting other contributions would improve this score.
Learning: Provides lots of knowledge to the team on events, but verifying the information before sharing could improve this score. Same more accurate information.

Initiative: Now that Jennifer has more of a handle on the position, I would like to see her take more initiative next year. Areas include programming and departmental event support.
Respect:  
Learning:  
Job Specific: There have been a few hiccups in Jennifer's performance when it comes to policy and procedures, but nothing glaring. For example, leaving the building during her duty night after the office hours. As soon as I informed her that she was to stay in the building, she took heed immediately and it was simply reflective of the fact that she was hired mid-year and training is not always as clear or thorough because it is abbreviated. She has been a positive and pleasant addition to the staff and I've appreciated her can-do attitude.

Attendance: Ben is always known for his punctuality, generally arriving early to duty and staff meetings.  In the few times he had to be absent, he provided more than ample notice (often a week or more).
Accountability: Ben always took his position seriously, and strived to meet and exceed all expectations.  His devotion to duty is one of his strongest traits.
Teamwork: Ben is a strong member of the team as an individual contributor; however, at times, it seemed as though he was more content to work alone.  This could be a matter of team dynamics moreso than his own performance, but he was generally positive and worked to understand the team as well as he could.  In this, he has grown a great deal from years past.
Initiative: Ben is a "go-to volunteer."  Any time we needed something with done with limited notice, he was a first person to sign up, volunteer, attend, and lead.
Respect: Ben always showed devotion to the position, but occasionally distanced himself from others by being a bit too enthused about being an enforcer of policy.  To some, this may be thought of as disrespectful; however, his heart was always in the right place.
Learning: If Ben has one more year at Berea College, he most likely would have wound up in a hall leadership position.  He has grown leaps and bounds in his knowledge of the department, how to be engaged, and how to lead by example.
Job Specific: Ben did a great job this year, and I feel he has great potential as he enters the world of work ahead.

Attendance: Was late to several meetings and absent, providing little to no notice. While typically engaged, was not present for several staff programs. 
Accountability: Yannick is very good with residents and team interactions—Yannick is supportive of the Student Life mission and goals. Last semester, we asked that he be more consistent with administrative tasks. Unfortunately, we saw little to no improvement in completing duty logs, completing tasks during duty hours, or communicating bulletin board ideas. 
Teamwork: Yannick has a very positive nature and outlook, which goes a long way in a team setting. He has a strong presence on duty nights, in programs, and very good relationships with staff and students. We would like to see him be more productive in his collaborative efforts (such as duty nights and programs, Wellness Wednesday program, etc.) and work with administrative tasks—not completing these aspects can have effects on the entire team. 
Initiative: Yannick did volunteer for projects but did not necessarily follow-through—we feel organization would help greatly. Yannick does take feedback well and has very good personal interactions with others. Required numerous reminders for administrative tasks but was extremely helpful with closing responsibilities. 
Respect: Very respectful.
Learning: Yannick contributed ideas in staff meetings and was supportive of others. We did not see as much initiative this semester (i.e. hosting and coordinating own program, etc.). He demonstrates that he is a very hard worker and has great potential within this role—Yannick has been able to develop strong relationships with residents and with other staff members. He does need to work on administrative skills to be most successful.

Also, I have enjoyed working for and with Emily for the past two years and I feel that I have taken much away from this great experience. She has helped provide motivation and encouragement to the substantial growth that I have undergone these past two years and I am beyond grateful for that.

40875: I did a lot this semester, which I do not think was accurately reflected in this score. In past evaluations, I have scored in the 80s and I have not observed a change in my work ethic or habits in a negative way to warrent a lower score. In fact, I have performed some tasks this semester which would be considered extra on my staff, such as taking off the goodwill ie and cleaning and organizing the staff office.

Attendance: Brandon has strong attentiveness to attendance, and often covers for needs when others have attendance issues.
Accountability: Brandon was generally reliable in this position, but occasionally acted in less-than-perfect judgment without consulting supervisors.  He could definitely be relied upon to complete assigned tasks.
Teamwork: Brandon always demonstrated an interest in working with the team to accomplish tasks; however, at times, team members had to complete unfinished tasks in his stead (bulletin boards, programming, e.g.)  He treated supervisors and teammates with respect in many occasions.
Initiative: Brandon was generally decent in this area; however, at times, he would set things in motion that were possibly too large an endeavor to complete on his own.  Had he recognized and delegated some tasks a bit better, this area score would have been higher.
Respect: Brandon shows genuine respect for residents, supervisors, and co-workers.  He generally works well in environments where differing opinions are shared.
Learning: Brandon pursued a position in leadership this year, which involved a lot of learning about team leadership.  He has accepted a position in the HHP department next year, as required by his major.
Job Specific: Overall, Brandon performed well as an RA this year.  In a few actions, though, it seemed his vision overextended beyond his own capacity to meet his goals.

Accountability: Ron does a great job interacting with fellow residents, follows all rules and guidelines for RA's, and encourages residents to complete suite duty.
Teamwork: Ron works hard with his team to provide support for all residents.  He is generally content, and encourages other people to remain calm.

Respect: Ron treats everyone respectfully, and is comfortable listening as others share their individual viewpoints.  Listening is probably one of Ron's greatest strengths.
Learning: Ron demonstrated an interest in working through the Campus Life/Residence Life staff merge this year, and will meeting an academic requirement as a BodyWise trainer next year.  I hate to lose him as an RA, but am glad to see that he can bridge his academic and labor needs. 
Job Specific: Ron has been a great asset to us as an RA these past two years.  He does what is expected, tries to help out additionally where he can, and has done well.  His next position, I have no doubt, will be met with equal success.

Attendance: Devin could improve on this element of job performance.  At one point, we discussed how certain absences could appear to be far more egregious (weekend duty rotation, e.g.) than they actually were, but that perception could affect others' opinions of his work.  As a result, there was some improvement; however, there is still room for growth.
Accountability: Devin did a good job of completing most assigned tasks, when attendance factors didn't interfere.  Once that issue was addressed, his performance on the whole improved.
Teamwork: Devin is generally a positive and active influence on the team as a whole, and leads by showing willingness to do more.
Initiative: Devin was mostly reliable to assigned tasks, but didn't necessarily strive to exceed expectations.  If there had been a few moments where the question of "what more could I do"? had been asked, this area would score higher.
Respect: Devin has developed greatly in this regard this year.  He is often very interested in varying points of view, and works hard to get people to open up and share.
Learning: Overall, Devin does what is expected, but with little focused effort on pushing beyond expectations.  He is a reliable worker, and will excel in other positions in the years ahead.
Job Specific: Overall, Devin works hard to do what is expected.  Not a great deal more, but definitely shows an interest in doing his job well.

Teamwork: Aja verbalizes her eagerness and willingness to work as a team and values others opinions.  She had challenges following thru with her team and department with such meetings as Fresh start and understanding her impact on the team.

When she is in the right frame of mind and has her time management under control she can contribute a great deal to her team and position. Aja has more initiative with group work then sole ownership of a task. She often lacks communication to voice what she needs and to gain support from her staff and supervisors. 
Respect: Aja is professional in the work place. She respects fully the perspective of her team. Her team go out of their way to talk to her, touch bases, on duty nights to support her and she often has struggles opening up and communicating clearly her concerns to get the support she needs to be successful.
Learning: Aja is open to listening to feedback but often misses the sharing part.  She has the ability to learn and gain a great deal of knowledge but missed her connection to the position and how it relates to her personal development and what she can also give back to others.

Attendance: Jeremy is an extremely punctual person -- he manages a complex schedule of athletics, academics, and labor supervision for James Residence Hall.  In some cases, he reminds me of appointments that I schedule.
Accountability: Jeremy understands the serious nature of his job, and addressed residence hall needs well.  He takes and provides direction well, which is a great asset in a student supervisor.
Teamwork: Jeremy provides a very positive atmosphere for co-workers, while laying down the specific tasks that need to be addressed.  He understands humor as a asset to communication, and treats his leadership team as friends and family, which makes them able to come to him with personal needs.
Initiative: Jeremy generally handles most management issues on his own, with little need for guidance.  However, when he DOES need to ask a question, he doesn't wait forever to do so.  One of the most important skills leaders learn is when to ask for help, and Jeremy has this down to a science.
Respect: Occasionally, Jeremy's wit and sarcasm come off to some as disrespect.  This, to me, is not a serious issue, as I understand that his overall goal is to make most people comfortable.  He is very open to discussion of ideas, and is good and seeing things from multiple perspectives.
Learning: Jeremy is not shy when it comes to gaining new knowledge -- he asks questions and is generally interested where "the job is going" next.  He is very interested in learning as much as possible, so that he can demonstrate the ability to function autonomously as a leader.
Job Specific: I never have complaints with Jeremy's work in this position.  He is a fantastic leader and performs above and beyond expectations.

Attendance: Julie missed or was late to some meetings/ shifts.  She gave ample notice but did miss.
Accountability: Julie completes her jobs and tasks, occasionally has challenges with time management
Teamwork: Julie is overly willing to help out and support in any way and even worked in another hall.  Her challenge next year is to demonstrate to her staff her leadership in the student life department and encourage them to connect to the entire team, in addition to their hall.
Initiative: Julie completed job assignments.  She sometimes needs a reminder for items not in front of her (marketing in office, signs, memos )
Respect: Julie is very respectful of overs and may even over compensate for her abilities.  She is a stronger leader than she gives herself credit.
Learning: Julie enhanced the effectiveness of her team (3 of her staff went on to new leadership roles in student life) and she will be working in a new hall with opportunity to grow as a leader and individual.
Job Specific: Julie has been a delight to work with and I am excited to see her new opportunity next year.

Attendance: Taylor is at almost EVERYTHING, even when she isn't in charge of whatever is going on. She is timely and reliable.

Initiative:  
Respect: Taylor is the epitome of professionalism and has managed many tough situations this semester/year.  
Learning:  
Job Specific: Taylor's efforts have been practically flawless this year, which is why I nominated her for an award in excellence.

Attendance: Riley does a great job with personal attendance to duty and meeting attendance.  He seldom asks to be off work, and often picks up the slack when others need a back-up.
Accountability: Riley is generally reliable with the completion of assignments.  At times, there was a lack of programming in the hall, which he could have addressed to the team he led.
Teamwork: Riley is a hard worker and leader for the hall staff team.  Occasionally, the stress of the job would seep into his work with the team, and bring forth some negativity.  He has improved on this throughout the year, though.
Initiative: Riley could stand to improve in this regard.  Generally, expectations were met.  However, as the key leader in a residence hall, it would have been nice for him to question more along the lines of "what can we improve?"  This is a skill he possesses in other environments (academic, athletic, et al.), but didn't always translate to his labor position.
Respect: Riley treats his co-workers and supervisors with respect.  Sometimes, his directness and no-nonsense style come across to people as being disrespectful, which is a difficult task to balance. 
Learning: In retrospect, I think Riley learned a lot about the demands of leadership this year, even if it was a struggle at times.  He is definitely a go-getter, and is developing skills in learning how to command respect rather than demanding it.  That is a great step in learning to lead.
Job Specific: Riley has a great deal of potential to lead in many capacities, with some room for growth.  I feel that a position in leadership more directly associated with his personal skills will lead to greater success.

Attendance: Savannah is punctual and present for nearly every staff meeting, labor meeting, leadership meeting, and staff bonding activity. While she has missed a couple of times, she has provided advanced notice and sought approval from her supervisor. 
Accountability: Savannah has thrived as a Hall Coordinator this year--being very consistent with follow-up with staff and seeking new ways to engage her team. She supports the Student Life department and is always willing to help out. She was implemental in promoting the Ground Level Opening and assisting with Student Life recruitment and hiring processes. Savannah has developed organizational skills this semester and has worked on delegating tasks to her team. I believe Savannah has a lot of talent in working in this field, using resources well, and organizing people and promoting ideals. 
Teamwork: Savannah works well with others and supports her team. Savannah made efforts to "celebrate work well done" with her team and provided valuable feedback to her supervisor.  Savannah has made strong connections with each of her staff members, supervisors, and members of the Residence Life Department. Savannah encouraged high collaboration among her team and worked well with her sister-staff at Home Management.
Initiative: Savannah has required very little supervision over the course of the year. If she has needed assistance or clarification, she has always been willing to ask. She has completed all responsibilities without being prompted and quickly presented herself as a leader in the Student Life department. Savannah has approached several difficult situations throughout the year and uses thoughtful discourse to handle difference of opinion. Additionally, as a returning Hall Coordinator, Savannah has taken a difficult role and has completed her duties admirably.
Respect: Savannah is respectful in her interactions with others.
Learning: Savannah is always willing to help another—she is a very giving, passionate individual. She has a strong desire to learn and improve herself. I feel that her energy provides the opportunity for her to share knowledge with others. Savannah has been very intentional with engaging other staff members and residents in conversation about a myriad of topics.
Job Specific: Savannah meets and exceeds the requirements of her position. She has completed all aspects of her position very well.

40875: Marie was wonderful to work for. I am glad I stayed in the department to work under her supervision. I feel like I was greatly supported and addressed with professionalism and positivity. My previous experiences in Res. Life did not promote my growth or enhance my leadership skills to the extent that this year has and I am incredibly thankful to Marie for fostering such a positive and encouraging atmosphere.

Attendance: Thank you so very much for all your contributions and your efforts in ensuring the schedule is maintained. I am glad you have hung in there with us and appreciate all the slack you have been able to pick up at times!
Accountability: Not an issue but keep it in check as a manager to ensure that not only our time is held accountable but also others. We have kind of let others get away with a lot and our management team seems distracted. Hoping that next Fall we can get this back into check with a stronger team again. I will be working with you this summer to try to get this back into check.
Teamwork: Not an issue. Thank you for trying to ensure a strong team across the board. This can be challenging as you know at times!
Initiative: Thank you for trying to assess the situations that are going on when you come in and steering people into what they need to work on. Lets make sure to do follow ups.
Respect: Not an issue. Thank you!
Learning: Not an issue. Thank you for all that you have done in assisting in training the staff this term. 
Job Specific: Thank you for your hard work and efforts this term. I appreciate all that you have done for the team.

Attendance: Ciara has had some health issues which have caused her to oversleep, thus being late for, or completely missing work.  Another time she failed to notify me when she had an unexpected, last minute personal conflict.  She always makes up her time, but not knowing about absences in a timely manner has been an inconvenience, at times
Accountability: Very conscientious about the cleaning supplies and equipment.  Works efficiently.
Teamwork: Ciara is somewhat quiet, but very cooperative.
Initiative: Ciara has her routine down well, and follows it without intervention from me - unless there is something out of the ordinary for the day.
Respect: No problem with interactions; have not been aware of any conflicts in the work place.
Learning: Ciara came pretty well equipped for this job, but has reached out to extend her knowledge and capabilities (Country Dancers; job at LJAC for next year).  We were discussing just today the value of work such as hers here, as a life skill
Job Specific: Ciara understands her job, and does it well.

Attendance: You have had seven instances of no call/no show which resulted in three disciplinary actions.  Your attendance and lack of communication about your absences is totally unacceptable. 
Accountability: You had a bad start this semester with two no call/no shows.  After discussion and disciplinary actions, it seemed that you had improved. Now at the end of the semester you had five more no call/no shows.  This is a total disregard of accountability and lack of responsibility..
Teamwork: Disregarding our attendance policy and communication procedures is not good teamwork.  
Initiative: Your initiative is good when you are "on" but it is essential to be at work.  The good work you do when you decide to do it does not excuse your lack of work when you are "off."
Respect: You remain respectful in your interactions with your team mates.  Not showing up and not communicating is a total lack of respect.
Learning: Your willingness and ability to learn new things is excellent.  However, not coming to work or communicating with your supervisor reflects that you do not understand the value of your job.
Job Specific: Your work is very good when you are not distracted and disengaged.  We are hopeful that you can improve your time management skills and ability to handle your responsibilities under stress since you have great potential.

Attendance: Only twice was she more than a couple of minutes late - never more than :15. When she had to be out of town on a Sunday she arranged to swap with another worker.
Accountability: We have no specific 'assignments' for secondary labor workers, but there has never been an issue with her accountability.
Teamwork: As Sabrina works on Sunday, and many times had few to no "customers," teamwork was not a large facet of her job.
Initiative: No specific job assignments - other than coming in to open the library for study and generally keep an eye on things.  I saw no evidence of any deficiency in this area.
Respect: Sabrina has always been pleasant in respectful in our interactions, and I trust she is when she works, as well.
Learning: No "skills" for this job, but her commitment to attendance demonstrates her understanding for the need of this in the workplace, wherever that may be.
Job Specific: See above comments.

Attendance: Kaitlyn never once clocked in past the scheduled time - usually 2-5 min. early.
Accountability: The main job assignment is to be present & on time, giving access to the study area and keeping an eye on reserve books and generally being the "responsible presence."
Teamwork: As a sole worker Kaitlyn does not have to interact in that respect, but her interactions with all - faculty, staff and students - are always positive.
Initiative: As before, there are no job assignments here, but Kaitlyn is the consummate self-starter, as demonstrated in other arenas of her life.
Respect: Always respectful, but able to hold her own.
Learning: There are no 'new skills' for this position, but Kaitlyn appears to take each event/stage of her life and apply it to overall development.
Job Specific: As indicated in the Attendance item, I have never had a worker who was as punctual as Kaitlyn.  I have to give her higher marks for this, alone.

40875: Maybe if I had been treated with respect and dignity, I would have shown the same. I realized that I made mistakes, but that does not give you the right to invalid my hours of labor or the effort that I did put into work. And most of the issues that you mentioned happened within the last month of my labor hours.

Attendance: Over 40 hours behind.
Accountability: You can not be accountable if you do not show up for work.
Teamwork: Rakemeya was not a team player.  She did not interact well with her peers or supervisors.  She would be asked to do a task multiple times before she would respond.
Initiative: Not at work to show any type of initiative on a regular basis.  
Respect: As mentioned earlier, she would have to be asked multiple times to do a task.
Learning: You can not learn all about your job if you are missing over half of your shifts.
Job Specific: Rakemeya was not very productive this year.  I hope with her next position at Berea she shows a bit more of what she can do.

40875: This is not an accurate reflection of my work at Dining Services. I have taken numerous initiatives to help end dinner shifts early or on time. I have only missed three shifts, and I informed everyone about them in advance. For one of the three I was able to get a sub. Wanting to argue with a student supervisor is not showing disrespect, especially when I have plenty of reasons to do so. A supervisor placed me in dish room twice in two weeks in a roll; he promised that I would not be in dish room the following week.

Attendance: Time to time Austin does show up late for shifts. This is usually because of something he had previously scheduled. At times he will forget to let someone know but he has done a better job at communicating. I would encourage him to work on his scheduling and making sure to work around his work shifts. 
Accountability:  
Teamwork:  
Initiative:  
Respect: Austin has no problem respecting the workplace duties. He also has went above the job duties by assisting with pool duties. Austin also seeks to respect the Seabury Center with making sure the building is secure and has no problem making sure people who are in the building should be in the building.
Learning: There are some things Austin does need to learn but that is because a lot of the stuff was done during training and he was a mid year hire. This is nothing of Austin's failure, he will learn more as we go along.

Attendance: Isabella has had great attendance this semester. She has been coming early, and staying later to help with any unfinished tasks.  
Accountability: Isabella has been working on staying streamlined on her task.  She has been able to speed up her sewing and finishing of the baby blankets, as well as having some extra time to complete coasters.
Teamwork: Isabella has worked on helping make a sewn tag instructional booklet that will help new seamstress’ next fall semester.
Initiative: Isabella always has an inner part that drives her to be the best at what she is doing.  Being able to do and see things a certain way other than one’s own way shows how versatile one can be.
Respect: This semester, Isabella has continued to bring new ideas to the table that has allowed for everyone to be involved and to choose better options.  
Learning: Overall Isabella has worked on her sewing/finishing production time of all the various products we produce.  She has help produce the Rachel coaster manual that has decreased the cutting and pulling times.
Job Specific: I have seen Isabella succeed at this job.  She has learned a tremendous amount about sewing handwoven products.  The patience, detail, and consistence needed to complete this job has sharpened her abilities to perform other jobs in the future.

Attendance: Taylor has good attendance.  She still needs to send an email to me outlining her strategy to make up hours if she has missed.
Accountability: This semester I have pushed Taylor to find ways that will allow her to speed up her production time on her plaid illusion scarf warps.  Understanding where one’s time goes, will allow for positive growth in future job accountability. 
Teamwork: Taylor was very helpful in training the two students on the love knot and plaid illusion scarf weaves.  Her knowledge of the weaves is greater than she realizes, and allowing her to lead a student pushes her verbal communication on this  complex process.
Initiative: Taylor has taken a greater initiative to getting the plaid illusion weave correct.  It is an extremely hard weave to focus on, but I think she has stepped up to the challenge.
Respect: Taylor has a kind spirit that allows for her to communicate well with her coworkers, and the tourist or guest that come in to the studio.
Learning: This year Taylor has focused mainly on the Love Knot series, but recently switched to weaving the Plaid Illusion scarf that will be featured in the 2016/17 catalog.
Job Specific: Overall I believe Taylor has benefited from this position at weaving.  She has been able to mesh her job skills with her major (Art major with an emphasis in Fiber), thus giving her a chance to see the complete process of designing, weaving, and selling a product.

Attendance: Regan’s attendance is great.  She is great about sticking to her schedule and will call if anything is a miss or she needs to miss or make up work due to a conflict.
Accountability: Regan has stepped up this semester.  Her ability to fix things as they occur has been a tremendous help in getting out our product.  It is also important since she is setting an example to her coworkers.
Teamwork: Regan has become so versatile since she has done many of the set up procedures.  She can lead a new student through the beaming process, help train on fly shuttle if needed, or to mend blankets.
Initiative: Regan has gained more initiative with experience.  She doesn’t even think to ask "do you want help", she is naturally stepping in to assist.  She sees more of the BIG picture, which is allowing her to be more of a team leader.
Respect: Regan has a great relaxed attitude that allows everyone to feel comfortable talking and asking questions.  She is a wonderful supporter of the weaving program.
Learning: This semester, Regan has been learning more about the fly shuttle.  She has been gaining ground on the couch throw loom, as well as all the baby blanket looms.  Her biggest challenges has been the 40 yard warps for the fly looms.  She has gotten much faster, and more accurate on the mending phase too.
Job Specific: The weaving program has been a great mix for Regan.  She has gained the knowledge about weaving allowing her to see how patience seeps into every aspect of this weaving process.

Attendance: Jessica has ask off from her schedule, but always makes up her time.  It is important to be aware that schedules are put in place to maintain a consistency in the workplace.
Accountability: Jessica has seen this semester that other external issues (yarn) can al ter ones production time.  She has been working on maintaining the production time despite these issues.
Teamwork: I had Jessica take on a teaching role this semester when training a new flyshuttlest.  She has to see that her knowledge is great and to learn to showcase this with confidence.

Respect: Jessica has shown this semester a great improvement on communicating with the tourist.  She is more vocal and confident in talking with them.

Attendance: Sabrina was always there for the mission critical efforts.  Sometimes the day to day attendance was spotty, but she typically let me know if she could not work her designated hours.
Accountability: Sabrina always hit the mark when important deadlines needed to be met.
Teamwork: Sabrina always asked if team members needed help, and was there to support whatever needed to be done.  At events the office sponsored, Sabrina was always one of the hardest workers there.
Initiative: Sabrina always had great ideas to add to the process, and her passion for sustainability is what drove her to do the work - not constant supervision.
Respect: I think Sabrina really grew in this area.  During labor meetings, she would have strong opinions about a topic, but was also willing to listen and engage respectfully with others' opinions.
Learning: Sabrina has a natural curiosity and passion for sustainability which fostered her willingness to learn new things.  Even something as routine as accounting paperwork, she stuck with it to learn the system no matter how detailed or frustrating it was.
Job Specific: Sabrina was the first person to hold the Special Projects Coordinator position.  With no prior history to build on, she really embraced whatever was needed from her no matter the task and got it done.  She will be missed!

Attendance: ALWAYS on time for classes.  Was never absent for work.
Accountability: Work quickly and without error on all assignments given.  Dress was always appropriate.  Took care with departmental equipment (brain models, etc.) and maintained clean and organized work-space of the TA room.
Teamwork: Was present at all called labor meetings and worked collaboratively and in a positive, friendly manner with my other TAs.  Based on observations as well as comments from those in the class for which she TA'd, she was always friendly and professional, though with a somewhat difficult class.
Initiative: Was very good at completing all assignments on her own with only a minimum of initial instruction.  Made some suggestions on her own, but I often need (because of my own disorganization) more proactive suggestions.  I feel a little more time on the job will provide her with a greater sense of confidence to make more suggestions.
Respect: Always respectful and yet friendly and engaging.  As mentioned, the class for which she TA'd was difficult (in the sense of some of them being somewhat disengaged) and she handled this professionally, respectfully, and with aplomb.
Learning: She definitely has an interest in furthering her skills.  At one point in the semester I had intended much more training in some laboratory skills, but the work load often interfered with this.  I was impressed enough, however, with her quickness in skill acquisition and her intelligence to invite her to participate as a student research in my summer URCPP, which she accepted.
Job Specific: Yes, did everything I had laid out as her requirements--note taking, grade keeping, quiz grading, study session running, etc., etc. very well.

Attendance: Michaela is always on time for work, most times arriving early. She was very responsible in transporting students to their service learning sites and ensuring they were there in plenty of time to set up their projects. Michaela did need to be late for one service learning night, but she gave advanced notice and showed up before the presentation began. 
Accountability: Michaela is highly accountable in all that she does for her teaching assistant position. She grades assignments so quickly that she sometimes returns them on the same day. She also manages her time effectively to offer students support when they need it. She gives some additional time for practice and study outside of office hours when needed. 
Teamwork: A lot of the work of a teaching assistant is independent of other teaching assistants in the department. She does collaborate when asked to help with department wide study sessions. She did offer support for every service learning team and pitched in when she was needed. 
Initiative: Michaela can complete assignments including grading and group service learning feedback without need for constant supervision. In addition, she leads successful study sessions that prepare students for success on their exams. Michaela has grown in her ability to adapt to change although this is still an area of growth for her as she graduates and moves into her next job. 
Respect: Michaela exhibits professionalism in her work and was professional in her role as a teaching assistant for service learning. Michaela is growing in her ability to accept feedback and deal with conflict. This can be an area of focus in future work. 
Learning: Michaela works on understanding how her role as a teaching assistant is important for her personal and professional growth as it relates to work after graduation. Michaela can continue to challenge herself to take on new skills and assignments that push her outside her comfort zone. I also think Michaela can increase her confidence and work to share her intellect with others. 
Job Specific: Michaela served as an excellent teaching assistant for Abnormal Psychology. She fulfilled her job descriptions as outlined.

Attendance: This was a busy semester for Tiffany, but she handled her many responsibilities well. She routinely gave advance notice if she could not complete any task as planned.
Accountability: Again, Tiffany was balancing many responsibilities, but she handled them well and completed tasks on time or gave notice if tasks were delayed.
Teamwork: Tiffany is an excellent co-worker and is always supportive of myself as her supervisor.
Initiative: Tiffany works independently and is willing to adapt as needed. Because of her many responsibilities, she was unable to always take initiative, but she still did excellently at the planned tasks.
Respect: Tiffany always handles conflict respectfully and exhibits professionalism in all she does.
Learning: Because of her other obligations, Tiffany did not have an opportunity to acquire new skills this semester, but she freely shared her existing knowledge and worked toward success of all her colleagues.
Job Specific: Overall, Tiffany is an excellent TA.

I therefore strongly appreciate Dr. Williams' recognition of the many tasks I was balancing in the present semester. I enjoy working for her because she is always willing to give constructive criticism as the semester progresses, allowing me to grow and become better at my job. I have no inquiries or complaints regarding this evaluation. I look forward to being a TA again next semester.

Attendance: Was always on time, or gave AMPLE notice of a rare occasion when she would be late.
Accountability: Christine is the BEST office manager we've had since I've been at Berea (almost 20 years), and she was among the absolute TOP teaching assistant I've ever had (in that capacity last term).  She is exceedingly quick in taking care of assignments while managing multiple tasks.
Teamwork: Works extremely well with both faculty and with other labor in the department as well as with students in the program in general, and also our building administrative assistant (Johnna).  This semester she also interacted with other staff on campus, and everyone has always commented on how positive and effective she is.  She won one of the two departmental labor awards we gave out this year (and if we only were to award one, it would have been her).
Initiative: Christine often came to me with great ideas for the course I was teaching when she was TA or for the department whenever she was office manager, so she definitely is someone with initiative.  Once started on a project she will check in if she needs some feedback, but otherwise I can expect the job will be done well without much need for oversight on my part.
Respect: She is always respectful and professional in the department, yet exudes an upbeat, positive manner that we all have found so appealing.  This is true whether working with the faculty, other labor students, other students, or the faculty and staff from other programs on campus.
Learning: Christine is a quick study and learned several new skills while working, such as programs needed to put together our departmental newsletter.  She knows even the most basic job reflects upon her and upon the program so she always brings her best to it, something another person might have done less at by judging it not worth their effort.  I have always expected the best from her and she has never disappointed.
Job Specific: Christine not only met all the obligations and expectations of her jobs, but went well BEYOND them by bringing her best, and always looking to extend and stretch the position in ways that might not have been obvious.  For instance, instead of just being a TA and grading quizzes, she researched and designed grading rubrics for class assignments.

Attendance: Kidist is on time, prepared, and dependable.  I don't think she has ever been absent!
Accountability: Kidist is a model of responsibility, dedication and hard work.  She somehow manages to be a stellar Student Supervisor and maintain excellent grades as a pre-med major.  We will continue to work together to find ways for her to get more sleep!
Teamwork: She shows each individual personal care and this helps bring the entire team together.
Initiative: She is excellent with follow-through.  Her initiative is sometimes limited due to the heavy demands of her major.  She is wise to find a balance and work within those boundaries.
Respect: She shows respect and care in her interactions with all people.
Learning: She soaks in the books we read together and it is clear she applies what she learns.  She has grown so much in her public speaking, pastoral care, and leadership skills.  One area in which I will encourage her to continue her growth is with her business and technology skills.
Job Specific: Kidist 'gets' what it means to be a student chaplain.  She understands that she is learning and applying life skills.  She is an excellent leader and a true asset to our Center.

Attendance: Leslie has not been to work in over three weeks.  He has not bothered to call in or to let us know why he is not coming to work.  He has not responded to my emails.
Accountability: as mentioned by attendance, he is not very accountable to his position here.  He can do a good job when he wants to but you have to be at work to get it done.
Teamwork: You can not be a team player by leaving your team to do your work.  
Initiative: We are constantly trying to locate him.  He is not working so he does not get anything accomplished.
Respect: By his actions he is showing disrespect to everyone he works with.  To not show up for three weeks without an word about where you are is not respectful.
Learning: see other areas.
Job Specific: See other categories.  Leslie's performance was very disappointing.  He had great promise as our marketing manager but failed due to his attendance.

Teamwork: Works very well with others.
Initiative: Works autonomously and without any supervision regularly
Respect: Very respectful, always.
Learning: So much learning.
Job Specific: Ishwar has done a great job this year, despite being in an odd situation with labor being split between TAD and CS. Ishwar worked extra hours with me as a secondary, because he enjoyed the work he does for us. Ishwar brought lots of great ideas to the team, many of which were contributing to the design of our systems. He has a great eye for online systems, and builds features with the user in mind. He doesn't take shortcuts, and does his research before implementing. Ishwar worked very well with every member of the team, and ensured ideas were heard and consensus was reached in decision making. Ishwar was core to the team, and I am extremely appreciative of his extra efforts this term.

Attendance: Eric is very good with attendance. He occasionally misses, but he always emails beforehand.
Accountability: Eric has improved in this category even since Fall. However, he still needs the occasional reminder.
Teamwork: Part of his teamwork is excellent and part could improve. Eric is very kind to others, and this means that as a lead in CSC 226 when other TAs are not doing their job, Eric is more inclined to be too gentle rather than too honest. This means sometimes other TAs get away with doing too little and the feedback is later in coming that it should be.
Initiative: Eric has sometimes emailed me to find out what needs to be done, and I have really appreciated this. However, at other times I have had to let him know feedback was falling behind. 
Respect: Eric is extremely respectful. He is a pleasure to work with.
Learning: Since Fall, Eric has become more effective in managing others. He has also learned to help others with a package manager.
Job Specific: While sometimes Eric is not as proactive as I would like, he is extremely reliable. If I need something, he will make sure it is done even if he needs to do it himself.

Attendance: Mr. Hunt has continued to improve upon his already good punctuality and has been an active member in our student "call back" program.  This program uses students to help resolve maintenance issues that arise during non-regular business hours.  His knowledge and willingness to help in this compassity has helped save the college by reducing the amount of overtime hours required by full-time maintenance staff.
Accountability: Logan has demonstrated repeatedly that he can  manage his time and resources well which helps ensure high quality service in a timely fashion.
Teamwork: Given his knowledge and experience in the program Logan has emerged as natural leader of our group and has become an excellent team member capable of working with peers, other department members, and the campus community that we serve.
Initiative: Logan demonstrated a high level of initiative early on in his tenure here and that has only grown as he's gained more experience.  I have no concerns leaving him in charge of the day to day tasks that need to be carried on in the case of my absence.
Respect: Mr. Hunt has always been a respectful young man but has really developed a level of respectfulness and professionalism that is rarely seen in a student.
Learning: Mr. Hunt has a personality that lends itself well to being both a continuous learner and helpful hand.  He has been very instrumental in the training of the rest of our team.
Job Specific: Logan stepped into help fill the void left when his fellow student and previous student supervisor decided to leave school.  He wasn't required at the time to assume that responsibility, but he did.  Not only did he accept that challenge but he far exceeded my expectations of him in that role.

Attendance: Not only does Noah arrive on time for work as scheduled, but he arrives fully prepared!  And, to my knowledge, he didn't have a single conflict with his work schedule.
Accountability: Noah truly excells in this area.  I could always depend on him for any project tackled to be done on time and with great results.
Teamwork: Noah is one of the most positive people I've ever met which really is important to fostering a good team.  He always steps up to help and support me and his team mates.  He is my right hand person in his role as student sustainability coordinator, so he has a very detailed understanding of how each part is working in connection with the whole.
Initiative: Noah continues to be an accomplished self starter and always completes job assignments without need for supervision.  Noah stepped in for me many times over the course of this year, and handled it all like a seasoned professional which I appreciated very much.   
Respect: Noah has a mature respect for all people. He impresses me with his desire to understand a person or situation before taking any action.  To me, that's a sign of healthy, mature respect for all.
Learning: This is another area where Noah excells.  He has a healthy curiosity for all things which will undoubtedly make him a life long learner. Noah tackles each new endeavor with gusto!

Attendance: I gave Annette an exceptional here because not only does she hit the basics of being punctual and provides advance notices of absence in the rare occasion she needed to, but she shows up fully prepared to work and produces an incredible amount of quality work while she's here.
Accountability: She is a pro beyond her years with how she manages her time while taking on a large amount of deadline driven assignments - and meets the deadline every time.  Annette amazes me with her abilities in this area.
Teamwork: Annette is a fantastic team player, jumping in to help me and her co-workers on a wide variety of initiatives and needs.  She is my "go to" person in a crunch and handles it all like a true professional.
Initiative: Annette is the very definition of a self-starter. She has the rare ability to both think creatively and act on her ideas and bring them to fruition.  I most definitely do not need to supervise her work... merely support and get out of the way!
Respect: Annette is a true professional and shows a mature respect for everyone she works with.
Learning: Annette will be a life long learner because of her natural curiosity and creativity. There has never been a project she has shyed away from or didn't master in a very short period of time, no matter how steep the learning curve.  
Job Specific: Annette is a superstar.  She far exceeds the basic labor requirements and objectives, and is one of my most valued labor students. She contributes volumes to the running of our office as soon as she hits the door!  I'm dreading her graduation next year already!

Attendance:  
Accountability: Shelby had an enormous task to fulfill this year - the first ever Dandelion Festival - and delivered it beautifully while launching this position from scratch.
Teamwork: Shelby really excelled in this area.  She managed to produce the first dandelion festival in Berea's history like a pro, and no matter how stressful the conditions, she stayed upbeat and positive with me and her co-workers.
Initiative: Shelby is the definition of a self-starter.  With her position of Sustainable Foods Coordinator, she had no history to build from, so she really took the initiative to propose efforts in alignment with the position and our office and got the job done.  We would meet once a week to see where projects stood, but she really took it from there and made it happen.
Respect: Shelby is extremely respectful, professional, and mature in working with everyone - staff, faculty, and students.  
Learning: It was a joy watching Shelby learn new project management, people management, and delegation skills.  She was always ready to learn about doing things better, differently, more effectively with no hesitation.  And, by the time the festival rolled around, she was handling it all like a seasoned pro.
Job Specific: Shelby is a superstar.  She has set the bar very high for future sustainable foods coordinators.  She brought this position to life for all of us, produced a highly successful dandelion festival, got the ball rolling to become a Food Recovery Network Chapter to help feed some of our Berea off campus at risk students, and all with a positive and professional attitude.  She has a creat ed a legacy to be proud of. I will miss her terribly, but know she has a bright future ahead.

Attendance: Ashley almost always arrived on time for the French Table.  In fact, she usually arrived early.  If for some reason, she couldn't come to the French Table or to one of her office hours, she let me know.
Accountability: Some of these items--safety requirements, college equipment, etc.--don't really apply to this labor position.  However, Ashley seemed to manage her time pretty well and she did what I asked her to do in a timely way. 
Teamwork: The third criterion doesn't really apply to this labor position.  However, Ashley was very willing to coordinate with me, for example, in choosing the times for her office hours. Moreover, she was very willing to collaborate with me at the French Table, for instance, by talking with students at one table while I spoke with students at another table.
Initiative: Ashley tutored students during her office hours with little supervision from me.  She took the initiative to extend her office hours before final exams to make it easier for my students to meet with her.
Respect: Ashley is always very respectful, not only toward me and my colleagues in Foreign Languages, but also toward the French students she is helping. 
Learning: Ashley always wants to learn new knowledge and skills.  However, I am often so busy with my classes that I don't always take the time to work with my TAs on how they could help our students even more.  This was especially true this semester since I was teaching four courses.
Job Specific: Ashley definitely fulfills her labor requirements and my expectations.  If we creat ed a job description with a more detailed list of tasks that she could perform, I have no doubt that she would also perform these tasks well.

Attendance: Although Cayla's office hours were on nights and weekends and I cannot attest to her punctuality, I can say that students never reported that she was late or absent.  
Accountability: Cayla is immediately responsive to email; when I asked for her help, she provided an expected turnaround time, and met that deadline or sometimes beat it.  I had no doubt that she would follow-through with what she planned or agreed to do.
Teamwork: She was very collaborative and helpful, both in assisting me, and meeting with the students.  They mentioned some of the helpful things she had told them, either in one-on-one meetings or during the workshops, which she initiated, planned, and presented.  She seemed to have a strong understanding of what would be helpful to the students.
Initiative: As I noted, Cayla came up with the idea of having Sunday evening workshops for the students - they were entirely on her initiative.  She also came up with the idea of having students meet with her one-on-one early in the semester.  Without my suggesting it, she provided a paragraph of summary for each and every meeting she had with the students - and there were 14!  
Respect: Again, I didn't observe Cayla's work with the students directly but I only heard positive things from them about her helpfulness and graciousness.  She is ALWAYS respectful and pleasant to interact with, in my experience.
Learning: As I've already indicated, Cayla was eager to share her experience and knowledge; her work in GSTR 110 obviously provided background and training in ways of assisting first-year students, and she put this training to work in very useful ways.
Job Specific: Cayla provided guidance, support, and encouragement for the students.  She also provides assistance and support that made my work easier.  She is TERRIFIC at providing MLA citation and format guidance - I learned that I could turn over bibliography checks entirely to her without having to double-check her work.  The results of her assistance in this regard showed very clearly in the quality of the lists of works cited submitted by my students with their final papers.  She was also a helpful editor of the students' writing generally, asking good questions and providing helpful suggestions.  I would've certainly hired her again for my GSTR 110 class if she hadn't been hired by another faculty member!

40875: I really enjoyed writing with Dr. McDonald. I think that the general timeline of quirk for students was helpful, because I could plan which weeks would need more attention and also plan workshops around it. Another strength, was her accessibility and support for doing workshops and meetings.

Attendance: Perfect attendance.  On rare occasions when Aaron needed to miss class, he notified me well in advance.
Accountability: Aaron is very dedicated and conscientious.  He worked hard to ensure all students had ample opportunities to complete missed quizzes and improve the quality of their weekly Moodle postings.
Teamwork: Aaron is both capable and committed.  Students in the PSY 210 course recognized his expertise and appreciated his ability to assist them in preparing for quizzes, but, more importantly, with the group laboratory projects.
Initiative: Aaron agreed to serve as teaching assistant for one of my PSY 100 sections as well as my PSY 210 section with an additional 5hr/wk labor position.  This was a great help to me and students in both courses.  
Respect: Aaron epitomizes respect.  He consistently treats others, students as well as faculty members, with courtesy and consideration. 
Learning: Aaron is a perpetual learner.  he asks great questions and often takes the initiative to find answers for himself and for others.
Job Specific: Aaron's performance as a Teaching Assistant in the psychology continues to be outstanding.  This was a very busy semester with many challenges and considerable competition for Aaron's attention. Keeping up with the demands of students in two distinctly different courses as well as his own demanding academic schedule was quite an accomplishment.

I'm glad that I was able to help him out with his courses; working with his students this past semester has been a fantastic experience.

Attendance: Will arrives early to class and is always on time for labor meetings. He keeps regular office hours. 
Accountability: Will consistently provided timely feedback for students on written assignments. At one point Will did not log his hours and that caused some difficulty with his time sheet. I believe this could indicate an area for improvement related to time management. 
Teamwork: Will promotes a positive atmosphere for students in GSTR courses and understands that he is part of a larger system that focuses on improving student writing. Will has a positive attitude and that is greatly appreciated by myself and students. 
Initiative: Will is able to grade assignments without need for constant supervision. When he did have questions he made sure to ask for support. I think as Will continues as a TA/PL he will grow in his confidence around giving feedback for student writing. 
Respect: Will is very respectful in the classroom, with students, and during labor meetings. While there were no real instances to deal with conflict, I imagine he would respect the position of others while also offering his own views. 
Learning: Will is always wanting to know how he can improve as a TA/PL. He wants to acquire better skills to assist in student writing and feedback. He also understands that by being able to teach writing skills he is also improving his own writing. Will was willing to share his knowledge about APA citations and formatting with the students. 
Job Specific: Will did everything that was asked of him this semester. He was present and participated in class and made connections with students. As stated before, I think the longer he is a TA/PL he will gain confidence to participate more in classroom sessions, provide more in-depth feedback on student writing, and have creative ideas to improve the research paper process for students.

Attendance: For the most part, Andrew was reliable about showing up punctually for work. There were a couple of instances when he didn't show up; sometimes he emailed in advance and a few times he didn't. But he always apologized afterwards and if he missed a student meeting, he went out of his way to accommodate the student's schedule and find another time to meet. On the whole, I'm pleased with his reliability. 
Accountability: Andrew did a great job of completing job assignments in a timely fashion.
Teamwork: Andrew worked well with me in the classroom to elaborate on points I was making. His voice was a valuable addition to our class, both in the classroom and in individual student meetings. He's a good team player.
Initiative: If I gave Andrew a job assignment, I knew I could trust him to get it done. He's mature and self-directed.
Respect: Our class addressed issues of race, class, gender, and Appalachia, which are touchy topics to say the least. Andrew is absolutely part of the reason we had a successful classroom culture. He modeled thoughtfulness and respect when discussing difficult issues. His fair and calm manner really helped set the tone for our class.
Learning: I learned a lot from Andrew this semester, such as how to use the MEAL plan to write a paragraph. We all benefited from his knowledge. Also he learned things as well, and we had great discussions after class about various aspects of teaching. I'm sure if Andrew chooses to continue his studies and stay in academia, he'll be a great teacher.
Job Specific: Several of our students told me (and Andrew) that he was the best T.A. they had ever had. Andrew excels at working one on one with students on all aspects of their papers. I'm sad he's graduating! He has been such a gift to our students. He's really great at his job, and it will be tough to find another T.A. as skilled and dedicated as he has been.

Attendance: Claire is often in class even before I arrive, ready and willing to help with whatever needs to be done that day.
Accountability: Excellent job! Makes time for students even when they are not as respectful of her time, which is impressive.
Teamwork: Anything I have asked Claire to do or assist me with, she has done and is good at giving me feedback about what I might be able to do better. I very much appreciate her candor and cooperativeness.
Initiative: All of the above words describe Claire to a tee. She basically doesn't need me at all. Very efficient and knows what needs to get done.
Respect: During many times in the semester, Claire has given me a new way to view a class session or some advice about how to move forward. From my understanding, all of the students love her and enjoy working with her. In this way, she is able to negotiate between the needs of students and the needs of the course.
Learning: As I have mentioned before, Claire has definitely shared her knowledge with me in a very instructive and helpful way.
Job Specific: She assists me in the classroom and outside of the classroom during her office hours. She has exceeded my expectations and been a major help.

Attendance: Whenever Jonathan found it necessary to adjust the particular arrival or early departure from class or adjust other work assignments, he communicated in advance with me. There were no problems with this procedure. It worked well throughout the course. 
Accountability: Jonathan holds his performance to very high standards and I appreciate this attribute. He managed his time well; there were extra demands outside of regular in-class sessions for CFS 334--Culinary Arts and Foodservice Management, particularly during the second portion of the course when specific events occurred.  He supported our laboratory guidelines, policies, procedures, and other practices well.
Teamwork: Jonathan was especially capable of working extremely well as a team member for the two classes he assumed responsibilities for--culinary arts and foodservice management and fundamentals of nutrition. He worked well with students in these classes, as well as with his fellow TAs and other labor students in the Child and Family Studies Program and students in CELTS, with our Service-Learning component for the Fundamentals of Nutrition course. He is a strong team member and coordinated our events in the culinary arts class with CELTS for the Empty Bowls Event at Woods Penn Building. This was a complex activity and Jonathan was heavily involved in multiple dimensions of this project to reduce food insecurity in our Berea community.
Initiative:  
Respect: Jonathan was involved heavily in the lab component of Culinary Arts and Foodservice Management. He demonstrated professional conduct and modeled this for his peers in the class. This attribute was especially important for the planning and implementation of events throughout the latter part of the course.
Learning: Jonathan successfully completed the Culinary Arts and Foodservice Management course during spring 2014. He offered constructive input throughout the course, gave direct supervision and when needed, appropriate intervention to contribute to the success of class exercises and major events. His enhanced interpersonal skills were very supportive of the learning that needed to occur among the students, particularly to enable them to develop quickly a sense of team spirit and to work successfully as a team.
Job Specific: As TA for Culinary Arts and Foodservice he exceeded basic requirements and objectives. He demonstrated advanced interpersonal skills to really guide students in a supervisory role. He observed and offered constructive input. He joined the group to complete tasks when we were slightly off our time schedule. Jonathan's work contributed to an important component to help the students succeed in their group projects and events.

Attendance: Sarah had a baby a few weeks before the start of the term.  We started her work load off rather slowly to give her time to recover from childbirth and having a newborn to take care of.  As the weeks went by, we increased her work load so that she would meet her labor hour obligations.  This worked out well for both of us as the course she was TA for had more papers to grade after midterm.
Accountability: She always accomplished the work I gave her in a timely manner.
Teamwork: She worked well with the students and me.
Initiative:  
Respect: She was always respectful to the students and to me.
Learning: This was the first time Sarah was a TA and she undertook to learn what all was required of her job.

Attendance: Destiney always gave me advanced warning and notification if she was sick, going to be late, or couldn't make her TA hours.
Accountability: Spring semester was a bit rough for Destiney because of medical reasons.  She was sick quite a bit.  This was not the issue but because she was in and out and our schedules never seemed to synchronize because I had to travel a lot, we never got in a comfortable routine like in the fall.
Teamwork: Destiney was always able to work with others.
Initiative:  Spring was a hard semester and  I had to remind Desitney a little more than in the fall semester about some tasks. This is not a criticism just an observation. 
Respect:  Destiney was always respectful.
Learning: Spring semester, as mentioned previously, was difficult for Destiney and she did a great job under the circumstances. The spring wasn't about learning more in her position as a TA as much as it was in not getting behind.
Job Specific: Overall, Destiney did a great job this entire academic year.  We have spoken about the work/life balance and knowing when and how to establish boundaries.  This was the issue.  Destiney burned herself out in the fall and didn't take care of herself.  As a result, she became very ill in the spring.  Her body caught up with her!  I think she processed this situation well and learned a lot from it.

Attendance: Margaret struggled during the fall semester with being on time or having consistent attendance.  There were times when she would inform me that she was not going to be attending, and times when she wouldn't. 
Accountability: Margaret didn't have problems managing equipment correctly.  Her issues related to time management in this case. 
Teamwork: Margaret did a fair job in this area.  More often than not, she saw herself as a member of the class as opposed to being in the role of TA. Most of the time this was not a problem, but there was one specific student who did need her assistance in terms of modifying texts, etc. 
Initiative: Margaret struggled with being a self-starter.  Some of this also related to her attendance issues. 
Respect: Margaret generally had a very positive disposition. 
Learning: Margaret was very interested in acquiring new knowledge and new skills. 
Job Specific: Margaret is average on this particular item.

Attendance: While Michael's attendance in lab was excellent, his "attendance" to the feedback for the CSC 226 was mixed. Early in the term it was poor. After speaking with him, it improved, but he never really gave rich feedback to students, and sometimes his work lacked care.
Accountability: Michael did an excellent job in lab. In fact, he was one of our better TAs in this capacity.  He made personal connections with students. He was not as accountable with feedback.
Teamwork: In terms of helping other TAs in the lab, Michael is tremendous. He let the team down in the grading area.
Initiative: Michael did not take initiative on grading or feedback in the earliest part of the course. However, he took great initiative in lab.
Respect: Michael is always very respectful, even when he is receiving constructive criticism. He is also very respectful with students.
Learning: Michael has done a nice job of learning how to be a TA. He is very effective in thinking on a white board with others.
Job Specific: Overall, Michael's excellent lab work has balanced out his weaker work in giving feedback.

Initiative: Sloane has great initiative. She is very dedicated and is very thorough, which tends to make feedback take a long time.
Respect: Sloane is always extremely respectful. I find her a real pleasure to work with.

Job Specific: This year was a challenge for Robert. Despite some hiccups, Robert managed himself and his work professionally. He was great about communicating his needs throughout the term, and ensuring I knew what challenges he was facing outside of labor, so I could adjust accordingly. Regarding Robert's work, he does excellent work, researches solutions before inventing new ones, thinks about the big picture before implementing anything new, and ensuring changes that are made are done in a responsible, secure, and professional representation of our software engineering team.

Attendance: Angela communicates clearly any times that she may need to miss labor.
Accountability: Angela can be counted on to do the work that she takes on.
Teamwork: Angela takes on additional responsibilities where it benefits the rest of the TA team.
Initiative: Angela has served well in a difficult TA position. Working to keep processes going without prompting (evaluation, etc.) and identifying other work that needs to be done would be valuable, but hard to do in the current environment.
Respect: Angela always demonstrates respect for her colleagues and the students she works with.
Learning: In the general case, Angela does this very well. In this particular position, I do not feel I provided the best opportunities for this kind of sharing and demonstration; her outreach to other TAs to support them in their work is evidence of her excellence in this area.
Job Specific: Angela has served as an excellent TA for the CS department this year, working on two upper-division courses with a faculty member teaching them for the first time. Her energy and initiative are highly valued, and we are grateful for her effort and support of the CS program.

Job Specific: Guillermo impressed me this term. He really took the lead of the software engineering team, without being asked. He made decisions autonomously, and always let me know what was going on so I was never in the dark about those decisions. Guillermo did some great work in building process for our team, which we will be implementing more judiciously this summer and on. He managed his time well, balancing his coursework, personal life, and work life. Guillermo loves the work he is doing, and it shows in the quality of his end products. I'm happy to have him working for me again next year, and look forward to the leadership he brings to the team.

40875: I would agree with Dr. Messina that my attendance could have been much less spotty this last semester. Among some academic obstacles, there were several personal issues (relationship, health, etc.) associated with my lack of punctuality. I will make it a priority to improve my attendance in the future.

Attendance: Kyleigh plans a good schedule, but does not always keep the schedule.  Although I remain flexible with respect to her inconsistency in this regard, this pattern occurred periodically as a result of her own personal struggles this year.  She does try to correct any issues that arise as a result of her tardiness, however; and she always makes up her time missed.
Accountability: She completes very well all assignments.
Teamwork: A great partner in the Religion Program, as a T.A. for the Department.

Accountability: I have no complaints, but Zach has been overwhelmed at times and took longer to give grading and feedback than expected. 
Teamwork: Zach has a relaxed character that is well suited for teamwork. He helped the TAs for a different class than the one he was hired for, and this leads to a good collegial environment.
Initiative: Zach generally waits until I recommend doing something before trying to tackle it. On the other hand, he is teaching himself the material because he has not taken the class before.
Respect: Zach always works will with others and respects their decisions. He has always been amenable to my ideas about how he could learn the material and he tries. 
Learning: Zach seems to be waiting to find something that would really interest him and is trying many things to find it. He likes computer science and being a TA, but his curiosity has not been actively engaged as it could be.
Job Specific: Zach has performed his job well and did all that was asked of him.

Attendance: Quinten has had some challenges to make the labs, but he always let the lead TA know.
Accountability: Quinten has had times when he felt overwhelmed and needed some reminders to complete his grading responsibilities. 
Teamwork: Quinten works pretty well with the other TAs and tries to help the CSC226 students when the lab was swamped.
Initiative: Quinten needs reminders to complete the grading; he tried to use a whiteboard but lost his marker. he is also thinking about his high course load and how to reschedule it to get more time.
Respect: Quinten is very respectful to me and the other TAs.
Learning: Quinten has helped with the course design and was eager to help out.
Job Specific: Except for the reminders, Quinten has worked very well. He can work on grading in a more timely manner, though, and I am sure he can get there with enough time and guidance.

Job Specific: Craig has grown a lot in the two years I have known him. He brings a certain realism to everything he does. Some often see it as negativity, but Craig is simply managing his challenges and acknowledging that he has to deal with them directly. As a senior, Craig could have easily "checked out" and done the bare minimum, but he did not. Craig creat ed a lot of assignments which were used in the course, kept up with grading throughout the term and rarely got behind, despite his busy senior schedule, and was clear about what he needed to be successful. Craig was a valuable asset in class, helping a number of students solve their problems while I was busy elsewhere.

Attendance: Andres has met with students outside of the allotted lab times and helped them.
Accountability: Andres is very accountable; the one regret I have is that I did not give him enough work.
Teamwork: Andres worked very well with helping students from other classes and helping to foster a welcoming environment. 
Initiative: When I gave Andres tasks, he not only completed them but very quickly. I did not need to constantly make sure he did as I asked. 
Respect: Andres is extremely respectful and brought a good sense of humor to our meetings. He was also very helpful for students in an introductory class without judging them personally. 
Learning: Andres constantly looked for ways to enhance his learning, which is impressive because he was a TA for a class he has not taken. He worked on the material before the class even started.
Job Specific: Andres was an exemplary TA.. I think that I was not able to give him work that would highlight his true abilities.

Attendance: Exemplary. There are actually times that the lab manager has to recommend she takes a night off.
Accountability: One of the most helpful TAs we have in lab. She goes around and asks if people need help. I grading and in class, she is consistently excellent. She is great with the students, helpful and timely with feedback.
Teamwork: Please see the previous response. Whenever she was asked to do anything, it got done. She never needs reminding. I had her run class when I was away, and I knew it would go well.
Initiative: She is extremely proactive but never in a way that is anything but professional.
Respect: It would be hard to imagine her being any more respectful. This is true with faculty, other TAs and students.
Learning: She has been working with Dr. Jadud to learn how to take a 3D printer apart and put it back together. She is very good at sharing knowledge.
Job Specific: Ashley is absolutely tremendous!!  If only we could clone her!!!

Accountability: Caitlin is a graduating senior, and we did not meet to discuss her evaluation.

There were sections of the course she was not able to assist, including not being able to drive a college vehicle or knowledge of Chicago style citation, which she did not express an eagerness to learn.

Initiative: Ashley constantly offers advice how she can better accomplish the necessary tasks for her position. She does not need constant supervision. 
Respect: For three years, Ashley has been the communicator between me and my students.She listens to all sides and strives to find a compromise position that works for all parties. However, she also knows how to make and uphold a decision when compromise is impossible.

Attendance: Bethany's attendance and punctuality are excellent.  If she ever had to miss work, she gave me plenty of advance notice.
Accountability: Bethany supports all workplace policies and procedures, and is always appropriately dressed.  She takes good care of college equipment, facilities, materials, and the work environment.  She also manages her time well, completing all tasks she is set thoroughly and when they are supposed to be done.
Teamwork: Bethany is so easy to work with, both for me, and for the students in the class for which she is a TA.  She has a very positive, open, supportive attitude.  She has a good sense of the kind of work that is appropriate for her to do as opposed to the work that is more appropriate for me. 
Initiative: Bethany completes all jobs assigned without having to be reminded.  She is flexible enough to adjust and adapt to changes in our schedule, the curriculum, students' needs, new tasks, etc.
Respect: Bethany is SO professional and respectful.  She is excellent at dealing respectfully with conflict and differing points of view. In a class like GSTR 210, many controversial topics are discussed.  Bethany is so good at maintaining her own point of view while respecting others' points of view at the same time. She is such a positive, calm, responsible presence.  Both the students and I feel we can count on her.
Learning: Bethany knows a lot about helping students improve their writing (and succeed in college in general), and I've appreciated getting to hear some of her ideas and approaches.  She's definitely interested in acquiring new skills and I think she has sought to reflect and understand the value of the job (especially in the overall context of Berea College, in which we say that all work has dignity and value), and relate her work as a TA to her own personal development as well as professional development.
Job Specific: Bethany has been very successful at fulfilling all the requirements of the GSTR 210 TA position.  She has met with students, attended class, participated in all aspects of the class, and met with me to provide me with feedback and give me her impressions of how the class is going and how the students are doing.

Attendance: Shahwar has missed a number of work sessions this semester, citing illness or injury. On most occasions she has given some advance notice, but there have been a few no-shows.
Accountability: This semester Shahwar has taken on more responsibilities, such as video editing, that have allowed her to set her own hours. We're not certain that she has always made the most efficient use of her time--but we also have to acknowledge some failure (on the part of both labor supervisor and cooperating faculty) to provide adequate frameworks for accountability. She has done a good job this term of making sure the program's camera is always ready to use and in the correct place.
Teamwork: Shahwar is a great team player.
Initiative: Shahwar can dependably complete tasks given strict parameters, but she has struggled this year to demonstrate more independence. Again, we must acknowledge some failure to provide scaffolding adequate to helping her develop greater initiative.
Respect: We can always count on Shahwar to be courteous and to demonstrate a friendly curiosity about people from all walks of life.
Learning: Shahwar has been eager to use her position as a springboard toward her professional aspirations in social media community-building, and has worked hard to articulate how student goals can align with the program's. We have all learned from her enthusiasm in this regard.

Additionally, Dr. Dickerson's knowledge in the field of radio, and patience in helping me learn the systems and procedures, were of great benefit to me. As a result, I feel much more prepared for potential future employment in this and similar fields.

Job Specific: Rebecca has a lot of small responsibilities for the CS program, and has had to manage her time wisely to fit it all into her secondary position. While a few things didn't get done, a number of other things happened instead. She started the planning process for a radio show, which was not originally planned, but she has owned the entire process and is working without any need for me to intervene. Rebecca has a lot of interests, and her biggest hurdle is focusing on those one or two which she can do well, instead of doing a lot of things poorly. Her ambition is admirable, and with a little focus, she will do great things.

Job Specific: Kye has been developing a new system for the Chemical Inventory program, and has been developing the system as a secondary position. Typically, a 0-5 is unable to get much, if any, work done in designing and implementing a new system. Kye is the exception to that; he has designed the entire system, and began implementation. His groundwork will be used this summer to continue that project, and much of the design work is ready for the student who will be taking it over. That is an impressive feat, as handing off code is always a challenge. Thanks for your dedication this term to the project, and leaving it in a place where future work can be completed without a lot of bootstrapping.

Attendance:  
Accountability: Anais has largely been working on an as-needed basis for us, and largely during hours when we can't provide supervision. She has been meticulous in her correspondence about when she can accomplish various tasks, what she has accomplished, and what she expects to do next.
Teamwork:  
Initiative: This semester, Anais has mostly been able to work hours during which no one can supervise her. She has consistently completed the tasks assigned and addressed other needs as she has identified them.
Respect:  
Learning:  
Job Specific: As a secondary labor student, Anais takes on probably more than her fair share of the "other duties as assigned" aspects of the job description. She has been cheerful and adaptable in doing so.

Attendance: Susan is very deliberate in her working hours.  She lets me know if there are to be delays, or needs to change her work times due to conflicts such as doctor's appointments.  She tries to give me advance notice when possible.
Accountability: Susan is an independent worker and I have been able to rely on her to pace herself with large assignments.  She checks in with me if she has any questions, if there is anything new I need to prioritize over the large assignments.  
Teamwork: This term Susan has worked pretty independently since I didn't have any additional TAs.  She was a wonderful collaborator with my 5 hour TA last Fall, however.  She also has received praise from our Departmental supervisor for her receptiveness and demeanor.
Initiative: I have very much appreciated Susan checking in with me and alerting me to issues with projects initiated.  She is conscientious, consistent, and hardworking.  
Respect: Susan has always been respectful of me, my colleagues, and her peers.  She is also friendly and upbeat which aided her work with students as well.
Learning: I have been able to assign projects to Susan and she has sought out help from peers as well as other faculty and staff (when a technology issues came up with which I was out of my depth or unavailable).  
Job Specific: Susan is very engaged in her work with me, even with work other students have found tedious, due to her interest in art history.  Her attention to detail and systematic approach has meant that a tremendous amount of work was completed this term.

Attendance: Satisfactory.  Jerry shows up for all scheduled appointments. Much of the work in this position is done on a task basis, without definite work times.
Accountability: Jerry has been somewhat inconsistent in providing timely completion of job assignments, and in showing consistent progress on long-term projects.     He needs to improve in this area. As his supervisor, I will provide shorter, more structured assignments will more definite due dates in the future. Fine on policies and procedures, and proper care of equipment.
Teamwork: Jerry meets my expectations in this area.  Jerry is supportive and collaborative.    
Initiative: Jerry works best in a structured, supervised environment.  We will work together to improve his self-starting abilities.
Respect: Jerry has been respectful in all of those areas.   He has not encountered much conflict in the position.
Learning:  
Job Specific: Jerry has performed most of his clerical duties satisfactorily when given a specific agenda and deadline, with one notable exception. He has not been as effective with consistent progress on more long-term, less defined projects.  He and I will continue to work together in the future to divide the long-term projects into shorter, more measurable units with sub-deadlines and concrete, definable steps which will be more frequently assessed.

Attendance: Jonah was always not only on time, but routinely early for all classes and meetings. He never had to miss a class or a meeting for the duration of the semester.
Accountability: Jonah manages his time well overall. He did face some challenges in completing a few minor tasks (e.g., writing review questions) but with regards to major assignments he was always on time with those.
Teamwork: Jonah is a delight to work with because of his positive attitude and his collaborative nature. He not only supported his colleagues but also myself as the faculty member.
Initiative: As noted before, in major tasks, Jonah did not need constant supervision and his work was of high quality. A few minor tasks were not always completely in a timely way.
Respect: Jonah always conducts himself professionally and treats all students and co-workers with respect.
Learning: Jonah showed enthusiasm for learning new skills and in sharing his knowledge with others.
Job Specific: Jonah is a fantastic TA, and I would strongly recommend him for any psychology TA position.

Attendance: Perfect attendance.  On rare occasions when Ashlie needed to miss class, she notified me well in advance.

Teamwork: Ashlie worked with the 50 students enrolled in both sections of my PSY 100 course.  several students commented explicitly on her friendliness and availability to help them with makeup quizzes and other course related issues.
Initiative: Ashlie is both bright and capable.  She did extraordinarily well in this first semester of being a teaching assistant, but I have no doubt she will continue to improve as she continues to look for ways to support other students.
Respect: Ashlie, is forthright and candid, but always shows great respect for other students and faculty.
Learning: Ashlie is very inquisitive.  She asks good questions and finds answers for herself and others.  Her consistently good performance as a student provides a model for the students in her TA section.
Job Specific: Ashlie worked hard at a job that was not particularly well defined and I did not always provide timely feedback and encouragement.  Nonetheless, she is well on her way to becoming a superb teaching assistant and i look forward to continuing our work together next year.

Attendance: Nana always does this.  Her work hours are flexible because it is a 5 hour position, but she always tells me when she is going to work - and then she works.
Accountability: Nana works in the print studio and she is always aware of safety issues and requirements.  She takes excellent care of the presses and the chemicals.  
Teamwork: Nana works alone as a studio assistant (equipment and materials) and then with me as a TA.  With me she is very willing to do the work I need and collaborates well.
Initiative: I meet with Nana at the beginning of her work time to talk about what I need completed.  She then comes to me with questions if she has them but often she is able to just complete the work alone.  When I can not meet with her, Nana completes work she sees to be necessary in the studio.
Respect: Nana has always been respectful and we have had some interesting conversations about a number of things where she is willing to consider multiple points of view.
Learning: Nana has done and excellent job in learning new skills.  This year she has worked with papermaking and copper engraving - both new processes for her.
Job Specific: As a 5 hour position Nana has great flexibility but in that she has successfully completed all aspects of her job with me.

Attendance: Dawa worked with the time schedulers to make sure her office hours matched with her timeline.
Accountability: As our web manager, Dawa answered every email I sent her within 5 minutes. She completed every assignment in a timely way. We entrusted her with the most public face of our website and she treated it with commensurate care and responsibility.
Teamwork: By definition, working on the CIE website is a collaboration among all parts of the office. Dawa is a positive, friendly presence and a pleasure to work with!
Initiative: A self-starter, Dawa was always looking for work to do beyond what people asked her to. She takes initiative to craft original artwork and text that highlights the work of the office. Independent and motivated, Dawa excelled.
Respect: Dawa ia super respectful and kind. Flexible and adjustable, I have never seen her in a situation of conflict.
Learning: This was a personal growth opportunity for Dawa. She will use all the WordPress web skills in the future. She has brought us forward and has shared her learnings with the rest of the office.
Job Specific: Dawa was a delight to work with and the saving grace of this office this year. She was always on point and efficient in keeping our website in shape. I especially appreciate the fact that I could give her half-baked ideas and information and could count on her creativity and resourcefulness to turn them into polished products.

40875: I appreciate Mr. Buckner's comments and feel the scores are more than appropriate. I felt as though I could have always done a little more, and done a little better, but given our short time (one semester) there was only so much that could be accomplished. I enjoyed gaining the new experience and learned quite a bit of new knowledge from Mr. Buckner.

There have been situations that you have also disrespected me as your manager/labor supervisor.
Learning: not an issue other than the fact that others have tried to work with you and train you and you have sometimes been insulting and disrespectful.
Job Specific: You need to work on your general attitude towards others and the things that you agree to take on. Continued lateness and just not showing up is not an acceptable behavior in any job situation. Please also work on working with others. You failed to follow through with several things as above and even did not follow through as others did in coming in for their review of their evaluation even though it was posted next to the schedule and emailed to everyone to sign up. Resulting in it being submitted without your cooperation in meeting with me as I requested.

Attendance: Jacob is always on time, and where he says he's going to be.
Accountability: Jacob is one of the most responsible young men I have ever met.  I basically ask him to make something happen, and he takes it upon himself to do it. 
Teamwork: Jacob only works with me - but he's very collaborative, and seeks outside assistance if needed.
Initiative: Jacob usually works on projects on his own, and rarely with my help - he just figures out how to do it!
Respect: Very kind and respectful.
Learning: One of the most impressive things about Jacob is how willing he has been to reach out to others on campus when he's needed assistance to get something done for me.  Sometimes he's had to be somewhat persistent, but he always gets it done.
Job Specific: Jacob  has been very patient with me while I learn this new role and figure out what I'm asking him to do.  He's been great to work with.

Attendance: Lukas again has been a very dependable worker. Although when basketball season came around he did slack at times to find someone to work for him and would do it last minute. After season ended he was very reliable. 
Accountability:  
Teamwork:  
Initiative:  
Respect: This semester, at times, Lukas could get a little argumentative when asked to do some tasks. We discussed this and he has gotten better at it. 
Learning: Lukas forgot how to handle membership paperwork at times or would forget to log certain items when checking out equipment. I believe this was just due to being a little more relaxed in the environment. After being reminded he did a better job.

Attendance: John didn't work his schedule as he should. He started Woodcraft behind on hours already. He didn't make attempt to catch his hours up.
Accountability: John completed jobs in a timely manner that he was working on. I couldn't assign him larger projects for him alone because of his attendance. He worked with people on other projects.
Teamwork: H e worked well with other students and got along with other students.
Initiative: He caught on to things pretty well once you showed him what and how to do something. He was a self starter.
Respect: He was respectful of people he worked with, not so much the supervisors because of his attendance.

Teamwork: Tyler did not have an established relationship with her editor and had a challenging time to talk to her Faculty Advisor. More advance notice of no work done would have helped her and Chimes to move forward accordingly
Initiative: Tyler did not present any actual work that she had started when she came to ask to get released from the position.  The score reflects a neutral score because I am unclear to her abilities. 
Respect: Tyler has the ability and show professional respect in email and in person. She is well spoken and can clearly voice concerns.
Learning: Again, gave Tyler a neutral score because there was no evidence or time with her to see her abilities
Job Specific: For the job and the assignments she was given, Tyler did not produce any work to determine her abilities
