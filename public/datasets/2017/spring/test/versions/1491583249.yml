  at the assigned time for departure, this was also the case when we departed for
  the Hunger Hurts Food Drive, required Bonner event. Thus giving advanced notices

  projects.  It will be important that she knows what she has on her to do list at
  all times and that she prioritize them in accordance of importance or timing.  She
  should learn to take a few minutes at the beginning of each shift to lay out her
  day.  Good plans don''t always get executed because of things that may happen throughout

  ask her to do.  I would like to see her take a more active role in the store when

  / week (secondary position)
- 'Katrina needs no supervision.  She is very trustworthy and dependable.  In the
  area of initiative, this is my hot button.  So, it would take a lot to get rated
  excellent on initiative.  Katrina is a self-starter and will do whatever needs to
  be done.  As just one recommendation for future improvement, I would say that Katrina
  needs to be more assertive and take charge.  If she was staying, I would want her
  to work on coming in each day and recognizing what needs to be done and then, as
  the store manager, delegating those tasks to others.  '
- 'Gabby has a plan of what she needs / wants to accomplish and she takes the necessary
  steps to get it all done.  '

  leaves her stressed over the decision. We have discussed finding ways for her to
  keep production schedule that allows for extracurricular activities.
- 'To Hallie''s defense, she was new to the store this semester so it took her a while
  to feel comfortable.  Now that she''s been here for a few months, I would have liked
  to have seen her look around and see what needs to be done without having to be
  told.  '

- 'Sarah, probably more than anyone else in the department - takes initiative by looking
  around and seeing what needs to be done.  Next semester I need her to step this
  up by evaluating the overall needs of the department daily and delegating those
  tasks to other staff members.  Sarah needs no supervision.  She is fully capable
  of managing the store without me or Steve in the store.  She has earned that level
  of trust.  But she needs to be more confident in herself.  '

- Matalynn is very good with completing assignments and finding a way to complete

  obligations throughout the semester. Within her role at HMH, I feel that Brittany

  with each individual resident--this is reflected in her residents’ and team members’
  frequent praise of her work. '

  it, but generally, he knows what to do and puts plans into action.
- Richard has done an absolutely great job with managing the day to day facility and
  resident needs of Edwards Hall. He has handled every situation with great attention

  she developed study questions to help students prepare for quizzes and exams. Many
  of these study questions are so good that they will be used in future semesters.
- Nick is very good about keeping up with his work and always completes what he sets
  out to do.  He worked on a long-term project throughout most of the term and kept
  that going without having to be reminded about it.  The only suggestion I have for
  him is to be willing to dig a bit deeper to find things to do or to find supplies
  in lab.  There have been times when he couldn't locate materials, when a bit more
  exploration would have uncovered them (e.g. lab supplies).  Similarly, Nick could
  suggest tasks that need to be done, rather than letting me suggest them.  This is
  Nick's first year as a TA, though, and I expect that he will get better with this
  as his confidence in the position grows.  Again, this is not problem, merely an
  area for growth.

  about coming up with strategies for analyzing and presenting data and in framing
  the questions we wanted to ask in the study.  When working on the study, she took

  would do her job and leave her position to eat breakfast while on the clock. She
  was reprimanded for this and complied. She sincerely did not see the harm until
  I shared with her how this looks to her teammates, how that it undermines the position,
  as well as does not honestly reflect her time. She apologized for this indiscretion

- Fahim is a self-starter, usually requiring very little supervision.  I'm impressed
  with his analytic skill.

- DeAnna is very responsible and an excellent self-starter. I can always depend on
  her to complete all job assignments accurately and in a timely manner. She never
  requires constant supervision and adapts to change when necessary.A great example
  of DeAnna taking initiative is when she recognized the need for improvement in the
  way she and her co-workers communicated with one another regarding unfinished tasks.  As
  a result, DeAnna came up with a well thought-out solution, wrote out a proposal
  for her solution and then presented it to me.  We immediately implemented her idea
  and have had great success with it.
- Madison is an excellent self-starter.  She never requires constant supervision and
  adapts well to changes within the office.

- Marshayla is an excellent self-starter and always completes her job assignments
  in a timely manner.  One way that she consistently shows initiative is by making
  sure the emails that are received in the Campus Visits email account are taken care
  of in a timely manner. In addition, Marshayla always comes in for her shift ready
  to work, which I really appreciate.

- Very stellar job at realizing what needed to be done and simply just getting it
  done. Anna is very mature and handles herself extremely well. She can be counted
  on in all areas of the job.
- Most of the time, Kerry did his main tasks okay.  However, there were some critical
  elements (lack of notice of failure to attend duty, for example) that make it seem
  that he was not always 100% into the job or the work details involved.
- Kyle seldom needs to be told how to do his job.  He could improve in this area by
  taking charge of more programming tasks in the hall.
- Kehinde picked up the slack sometimes when FAs did not or could not finish all the
  cleaning and that was appreciated.
- 'Kayla has improved in this area. She head up the EcoChallenge program. She addressed
  two major violations this semester with her suites. She''s tried to handle some
  things on her own first before seeking help. '
- Corey does his job at a good standard but needs to look for more opportunities to
  infuse his personality with his job. I would like to see him get more personal with
  his programming which will help his creat e better residence atmospheres for his
  residents.
- As he ha sbecome more comfortable within his role I have seen his tasks completed
  on time without supervision. I strongly believe he will find even more ways to increase
  his effectiveness on the job in the future.
- Helped out with big events on campus, but did not creat e too many activities.
- 'Jalen has been more consistent with bulletin boards and resident engagement. He
  was helpful in addressing a difficult situation on the floor. Jalen still required
  prompting and reminders for administrative tasks (putting hours in on time, duty
  logs), and being on time. '
- Needs to be asked to do things but is flexible with changing her day with other
  workers.

- Caitlin has challenges taking the lead on projects.  She is great in a group but
  has trouble taking ownership.
- Sam needs little guidance or direction to do his work.  He is committed to doing
  what is expected, and often takes on more when he can.  He is able to manage his
  time very well, and always seems to be able to "pencil in" time for additional tasks
  when needed.

- 'Justin helped out with others’ programming but did not take the lead on a program
  (an area for improvement last semester). He provided very good support for his teammates

  him to complete an assignment twice and he always followed-up as asked. '
- 'Kourtney always does what she is asked to do. '
- 'Kyree has made great strides in this area of his development. He is clearly comfortable
  with the job now, and has begun taking on more responsibility an even doing more
  future planning and visioning. '
- Meets Expectations
- Next year I hope to see Renesha take on more of a leadership role on the team as
  a veteran RA. She did so much work this year but it was from the angle of a supporter/follower.
  This is great, but she has potential to be an impactful leader as well.
- Meets expectations.

- 'Shannon is a self-starter and completes tasks without having to be asked. She goes

  She collaborated with the CIE. She also proposed and executed a Super Bowl program
  for the Student Life department. '

  been marked improvement with still room for growth. '
- 'Amber is consistent with the quality and efficiency of her assignments; has creative
  bulletin boards and programs. She addresses any issues on her floor or with her
  teammates in a timely manner, seeking solutions that benefit all parties. Amber
  was very helpful in addressing housekeeping issues on her floor and ensuring residents
  understood their role in the community. '

- Brandon does his job well and steps up when he is needed. I firmly believe he will
  continue to grow and improve his recognition skills as to when to move projects
  and tasks along.
- Gets assignments done when asked but does not start things himself. Should complete
  bulletin boards successfully without prompting.
- Kordell has really learned and owned his job. He is able to finish and execute his
  projects. I believe next year he will improve leaps and bounds in this area.
- Lazim was a mid-year addition to the team, and was really just getting the hang
  of the position.  It is difficult to assess how much personal initiative he had
  for the position, given the limited time of service.
- 'Rafael has really stepped up in this area. he has taken the lead on all his projects
  and done even more than was asked of him. '
- Was very quiet initially, and did the minimum work the majority of the time.
- Gabby completes tasks that need to be done without being asked and can be relied
  on for completion of tasks.
- Was a quiet person as well as RA. While one of his weaker points, it should be noted
  that he still met expectation.
- Now that Jennifer has more of a handle on the position, I would like to see her
  take more initiative next year. Areas include programming and departmental event
  support.
- I can always count on Taylor to finish her projects or tasks with the greatest level
  of attention to detail.
- 'As a senior in our department, Alexus has really shown how experience and job knowledge
  can be used to take initiative in this job. '
- Amy worked well with another team member for a big program this semester. She would
  keep the group on task based on the deadlines they set. She has done better this
  semester addressing concerns in the suite on her own - relying on her confidence
  in the training she has received.
- LeAnna is always stepping up within her role as RA as well as for the department.
  She is one of the students we trust in representing our department as well as leading
  initiatives for the staff and department.
- Ben is a "go-to volunteer."  Any time we needed something with done with limited
  notice, he was a first person to sign up, volunteer, attend, and lead.
- Floor bonding for the second floor continue to be amazing and creative events. Residents
  are going and Trinity's work here is well.
- Josiah has been very solid throughout his year in Edwards. He knows when to step
  up to help finish and execute tasks as well as how to help guide and support.
- Vanessa has to be reminded to complete tasks and what the deadlines are to complete
- 'Yannick did volunteer for projects but did not necessarily follow-through—we feel
  organization would help greatly. Yannick does take feedback well and has very good
  personal interactions with others. Required numerous reminders for administrative
  tasks but was extremely helpful with closing responsibilities. '

- Jessica consistently completes assignments and even goes out of her way for residence.  She
  always wants to stay on task and is a self starter.
- Good steward for Student Life--very participatory, completes jobs, has extended
  her opportunities within the division (interviewing, brushy fork, ground level opening,
  etc.)

- Brandon was generally decent in this area; however, at times, he would set things
  in motion that were possibly too large an endeavor to complete on his own.  Had
  he recognized and delegated some tasks a bit better, this area score would have
  been higher.

- Ron meets all job expectations as requested.  He could work a bit more diligently
  on hall programming, as discussed in one-on-ones.  However, he can be relied upon
  to show up and do his job.

  without reminders.
- " "
- 'JR is a self starter. He is constantly filling in the gaps. '
- 'She completes job assignments when she is motivated to do them. '
- Devin was mostly reliable to assigned tasks, but didn't necessarily strive to exceed
  expectations.  If there had been a few moments where the question of "what more
  could I do"? had been asked, this area would score higher.
- 'Aja has the full potential to be consistent with her job assignments.  When she
  is in the right frame of mind and has her time management under control she can
  contribute a great deal to her team and position. Aja has more initiative with group
  work then sole ownership of a task. She often lacks communication to voice what
  she needs and to gain support from her staff and supervisors. '
- 'She gets things done on her own. She makes sure her advertisements are complete,
  attractive and up in a timely manner for programs. '

- 'Faith took pride in going the extra step to put those special touches on things.  She
  never had to be told to get started or reminders to do something.  '

- Jeremy generally handles most management issues on his own, with little need for
  guidance.  However, when he DOES need to ask a question, he doesn't wait forever
  to do so.  One of the most important skills leaders learn is when to ask for help,
  and Jeremy has this down to a science.

- Julie completed job assignments.  She sometimes needs a reminder for items not in
  front of her (marketing in office, signs, memos )
- " "

- Riley could stand to improve in this regard.  Generally, expectations were met.  However,
  as the key leader in a residence hall, it would have been nice for him to question
  more along the lines of "what can we improve?"  This is a skill he possesses in
  other environments (academic, athletic, et al.), but didn't always translate to
  his labor position.
- " "
- Amanda completes assignments without need for constant supervision. Half of the
  time, she is reminding me of what needs to get done or suggesting new ways of doing
  things for the better.
- Savannah has required very little supervision over the course of the year. If she
  has needed assistance or clarification, she has always been willing to ask. She
  has completed all responsibilities without being prompted and quickly presented
  herself as a leader in the Student Life department. Savannah has approached several
  difficult situations throughout the year and uses thoughtful discourse to handle
  difference of opinion. Additionally, as a returning Hall Coordinator, Savannah has
  taken a difficult role and has completed her duties admirably.

  much need for oversight on my part.

- Shelby is the definition of a self-starter.  With her position of Sustainable Foods
  Coordinator, she had no history to build from, so she really took the initiative
  to propose efforts in alignment with the position and our office and got the job

- 'Brittany is respectful in her interactions with others. '
- There were many cases where TaLaka displayed a less than respectful attitude, both
  towards her superiors and towards her peers. Her negativity sometimes clouded staff
  meetings and made her unapproachable at times. TaLaka allowed her stress with academics
  and personal relationships to affect her job performance. When things were okay
  in her personal life, her work was okay...when things were not okay in her personal
  life, work and her respect for the position took a major backseat. In incidents
  of conflict, TaLaka displayed blatantly disrespectful behavior, specifically towards
  her collegium member. Any time she was given feedback about work-related matters,
  TaLaka would not accept the information in a professional manner and has stated
  that she is "not going to do it" when told to complete certain tasks. Her behavior
  could be described as aggressive at times.
- At times, Jacob rubs other supervisors the wrong way, and he sometimes lets comments
  from teammates and other supervisors upset his ability to function to full potential.  I

  environment is on a level playing field.

  initially engages new supervisors and teammates.  I have had the benefit of working

- 'Tyller worked well with students in her labor position. She had solid feedback
  from students. It is important to mention that two comments in our student survey
  feedback results that named Tyller as their consultant were actually test comments
  and were creat ed by an office assistant to test changes to our system. Those comments
  were: "Tyller is a dork and needs to take care of herself because we love her and
  would like her to not die" and  "Tyller was fantastic, effectively addressing all
  of my concerns for my paper without judgement or criticism. She was more than willing
  to share her resources with me, and gave me tools to continue work on my own."However,
  her lack in professional conduct in the workplace in how she talks to her peers  and
  how she refuses to work through criticism of her behavior in a professional and
  reflective manner is a significant reason for her low scores in this area. She does
  not deal well with conflict and refuses to entertain that she needs to work on the
  way she talks to people even after multiple complaints from per peers and from staff,
  including her supervisor. She does not respect the critical feedback given to her
  by her supervisor and instead of working on these issues sought to find out what
  peers and professional staff had filed complaints with her supervisor. This lack
  of respect and unprofessional behavior was further noted after the the directors
  of Career Development and Internships  reported that she was in the office after
  closing one evening and started asking them questions about whether or not they
  were the ones who reported her behavioral issues to her labor supervisor. For the
  latter part of the semester, Tyller''s disrespect  and behavioral issues creat ed
  and uncomfortable working environment. So much so that Labor decided it was in everyone''s
  best interest to remove her from the position as long as she had all her hours.
  Even with this decision made, Tyller still refused to respect authority figures,
  this time the director of the CTL who told Tyller to remand her CTL key to her labor
  supervisor immediately, which Tyller did not do until Labor was once again involved. '

  the procedure and composed a complete script rather than a screen at a time, he
  would have gained a better understanding of the entire process and it may have prevented
  some of the adjustments needed to finalize the project.

- Rafeal has been a great staff member this year in which he has used his knowledge
  to solve issues and manage situations well. He has also helped new staff members
  and has done a great job recruiting for our department based on his experience and
  knowledge.

  avidly met expectation with ease.
- Provides lots of knowledge to the team on events, but verifying the information
  before sharing could improve this score. Same more accurate information.
- It seemed as if he had very little drive to learn on the job, which was less so
  during his second term.

  has improved each year culminating in her last semester as an RA, doing an exceptional

  with the new staff coming in.

  and ensures that she helps anyone who may need help. she values her position which
  can be seen by the great attention to detail she possesses.

  to be in a leadership position next semester.

  Advisor.

- 'Yannick contributed ideas in staff meetings and was supportive of others. We did
  not see as much initiative this semester (i.e. hosting and coordinating own program,
  etc.). He demonstrates that he is a very hard worker and has great potential within
  this role—Yannick has been able to develop strong relationships with residents and
  with other staff members. He does need to work on administrative skills to be most
  successful. '

  needs to challenge herself with what she takes pride in and ways to apply it to
  her position.
- Overall, Devin does what is expected, but with little focused effort on pushing
  beyond expectations.  He is a reliable worker, and will excel in other positions
  in the years ahead.

  the ability to learn and gain a great deal of knowledge but missed her connection
  to the position and how it relates to her personal development and what she can
  also give back to others.
- Zakiyya has improved from last semester. She is a fabulous RA and really does well
  in this position.

- Julie enhanced the effectiveness of her team (3 of her staff went on to new leadership
  roles in student life) and she will be working in a new hall with opportunity to
  grow as a leader and individual.

- In retrospect, I think Riley learned a lot about the demands of leadership this
  year, even if it was a struggle at times.  He is definitely a go-getter, and is
  developing skills in learning how to command respect rather than demanding it.  That
  is a great step in learning to lead.
- " "
- I have watched Amanda grow in areas of assertiveness.  She is always will to ask
  questions to better prepare herself when addressing situations in the hall.
- Savannah is always willing to help another—she is a very giving, passionate individual.
  She has a strong desire to learn and improve herself. I feel that her energy provides
  the opportunity for her to share knowledge with others. Savannah has been very intentional
  with engaging other staff members and residents in conversation about a myriad of
  topics.
- 'Last term he was much more open to change. This term he felt closed off to learning
  and leaning on others this term. Overall he is a great mentor. '
- Chris is in his 4th year in the Residence Life Department and has been a winner
  or nominated for the top award in the department on several occasions. He has been
  a major player in recruitment this year and it is largely due to his experience
  and knowledge in Residence Life. He mentors many RA's including his own staff who
  has development one on ones with him to discuss personal academic and job performance.

- It was a pleasure to watch Miranda fully blossom into the leader she was. She took
  the experience in stride and, as stated before, led without me having to be concerned

  nature of her position.

- Jared started the year out as an RA and was called to serve as a Hall Coordinator
  when there was an opening. He stepped into that role with very little training and
  also managed a staff of 6 students with 5 being brand new to the department. He

  be extremely knowledgeable and effective

- 'Augusta did an outstanding job this semester.  Working on a 5 hour contract she
  accomplished all her projects and made a schedule for new items for next year.  Augusta
  exemplifies the Labor Program by taking jobs that provide real life experiences
  that relate to her major.  By the end of this year she will have written a lesson
  plan for stamping copper, review of other lesson plans (to standardize for website)
  and teach the project at workshops with adults and K-12.  Next year it is my hope
  that she will return to Outreach on a 5 hour contract to continue her work and gain
  more experience teaching in a workshop setting.   '

- As this was Kyle's second semester working within the ATR he has continued to grow
  as one of our workers. He did a very good job taking on a very demanding sport assignment
  and never complained.  He will be expected to continue to grow into one of our students
  that will set examples for underclassmen.
- Destiney truly stepped up her abilities this semester.  She will be more challenged
  in the fall with having to balance school, work, and volleyball.  As she has more
  knowledge and confidence working in the ATR it is expected that her performance
  only gets better going into next year. The track coach was very pleased with the
  effort she gave to the team.

- Caleb did a fantastic job with his assigned sports team, as they are not always
  the most welcoming.  He then made a smooth switch into the ATR where he became a
  large asset in helping with daily routines.  He has completed his job in full this

  the most experience on our student staff.
- 'David has grown into a more responsible and educated person which has been wonderful
  for our staff.  '
- Savannah was a tremendous asset working with our staff this semester.  She had more
  time to spend helping in the ATR this semester as she did not have an assigned sports
  team to work with.  The majority of the time she was asked to help open the ATR,
  as she did she always made sure it was prepared so we could start treating athletes
  as soon as we walked in.  She will most definitely be missed :(
- We have enjoyed working with Tyler for the last 2 years and will very much miss
  his presence in the athletic training room.  He has been an asset to our staff and

  her programs have been inclusive in addressing spiritual wellness. Justice is always
  on time and responsible. Fully present at meetings, she makes wise and honest comments
  when asked for her opinions. One aspect that Justice should improve on, however,
  is making herself more available for her residents. From reading her comments on
  Tracy and my conversation with her, I was able to understand that she didn’t do
  lots of intentional contact hours this semester.  '

  care while bridging the students that are in need of help to places like the CCC
  or Counseling service. While she loves her job and always strives to do the best
  she can, she still has room to improve in certain areas.  I think for next year,
  she should work on building her confidence and independence when planning and executing
  programs. '
- Sharpy is a very dedicated worker.  I have heard from his residents and his staff
  that he is their “go to” person. He cares for his residents and tries to connect
  with as many people as he can.  I think his biggest struggle is learning to tell
  people ‘no’.  He has put in several weeks of 20+ hours.  Also, his comments are
  sparse even after asking him a few times to be more detailed.  Sharpy always finds
  a way to be funny and is a joy to work alongside.

  Elshaday seeks to find out areas where she can improve up on to help her perform
  the best at her job. '

- 'Gabby is truly an asset to the department - in both the talents that she brings

  leadership qualities and she speaks very articulately and she needs to share these
  qualities by being a role model for the other students.  '
- Becca can accomplish any task she begins. She knows technique and can resolve most
  issues creatively. As mentioned before, issues complicated her ability to be reliable
  with work time, but her always made efforts to make up time.  Becca and I discussed
  how this can affect the ability for folks to rely on her. I think that a less hectic
  schedule would assist in her ability to spend more time as a designer in the jewelry
  studio.

- 'The quality of TaLaka''s work, although needing prompting, was good. However, a
  large piece of the job is being accessible and approachable to residents. Because
  of her negative attitude towards the job at times and lack of presence in the hall
  outside of her scheduled hours, it was difficult to see how residents felt comfortable
  going to her. Namely, her collegium member had to ask her to remove her headphones
  while on office hours and had to explain that she does not come off as approachable

  Corey in the fall term.
- Paola's class schedule made it impossible for her to work with us in class or lab,
  and so the bulk of her work this term was done on her own.  This called for a high
  degree of responsibility on her part, and gave her a different type of labor position
  than she had the term before, when she could work with students and professors in
  class and lab.  Paola's evening tutoring hours were rather late in the evening,
  and that was a further disadvantage in terms of interacting with our students.  But
  Paola's work on our Biology Department study was invaluable.

  in herself and comfort with me to start to take more of a lead in some of our teaching.

  are required to meet.  She even went beyond these at times with review sessions

  will be able to do.  I was one of the two people who nominated Kaitlyn for the Student

  together in her last term, and I will miss her greatly.

  is asked of him and then do it well.
- Works hard to meet and exceed requirements. Will grow an exceptional amount as she
  continues in her position.
- If not closely supervised, Chase does not demonstrate accountability to her position.
  She often arrives late, or not at all, and often does not tell me she is not coming
  to work.  She wears improper attire as set by the guidelines of this position. She
  does not seem to focus or be able to maintain general routines. Chase will do what
  she is asked, but does not demonstrate ownership or take pride in her work.  She
  does not feel accountable to the position, nor feel it necessary to tell me when
  she wants to go on break to smoke; she just leaves the building. Some may expect
  this sort of behavior from a freshmen until they receive direction; however, she
  did not behave this way her freshmen year.  She clearly did a good job then and
  this is why she was promoted to building monitor.  When I try to discuss office
  guidelines, she becomes highly emotional, crying and sometimes shouting at me.  When
  confronted about her absences or her work, she believes I am angry with her for
  no reason because I am understanding when she is ill.  She believes her work is
  a good as other students.  However, I remind her that she is held to a higher standard
  as a WSL4 position.  When confronted on an issue she believes I am singling her
  out. I am very concerned for this student's ability to focus, to discern critiquing
  from criticism, and her general understanding of work ethic.
- 'Adriana does her job well and without much guidance.  She did have an instance
  where she abused her position by leaving the job to eat breakfast and confusing
  some of her labor hours. She had a friend who was entering time for her.  We had
  a conversation regarding such and I do believe that the outcome was good; Adriana
  knew she had made a huge mistake.  To quote her, “the biggest one I have made in
  my life.”  Knowing Adriana, and in regard for her future at Berea College, I decided
  to handle this “inhouse.” I told Adriana that I saw her as a strong, capable woman,
  and if I believed, for an instant, she would not learn from this or did not understand
  the consequences of her actions then I would have not hesitated to send this forward
  to the Labor Program. She did learn and made restitution for her time.  I am very
  proud of her...proud her strengths and her accomplishments. She will do well and
  be an asset in her next position.  '

- Bree was a trooper this year in the BCC.  When jobs needed to be done, she stepped
  up to support programs and events across campus.  Her leadership with FABULOUS will
  ensure that program continues to impact the lives of young women on campus.  Even

  in the small daily victories at Berea College.
- This academic year involved growth for Lawynter in the BCC.  One of the biggest

- 'Below is a timeline reflective of the escalating behavioral issues. This timeline
  is justification for Tyller’s labor evaluation score of “Needs Improvement.”Week
  of February 22 – Talked with professional staff member who expressed concerns regarding
  two of my students. Concerns were that Tyller was being short with them when discussing
  work projects. Concerns expressed were about her tone, which was described as being
  short and biting. Monday, February 29 – Mid Term Review –I asked these questions
  because I had heard from a professional staff member that two of my students had
  expressed concerns that she was more concerned with them making mistakes and the
  work not being perfect than actually mentoring them in their work. I told her I
  was investigating this further during mid-term reviews with all the students. Week
  of March 3 -14 -  Multiple reports from professional staff and student staff regarding
  Tyller’s tone and behavior in the center.  Tuesday, March 15 – At Labor Meeting,
  Tyller responded to three students with sharp biting tone. This was the first time
  I witnessed this first hand, and did not call her out in the meeting. Intent was
  to talk with her at her manager interview the next day.  Wednesday, March 16 – Tyller’s
  manager interview – interview turned into a meeting about her tone and behavior
  because that was of foremost concern. I told her that I had seen it myself at Labor
  Meeting. She said that she had been working with these students for 9 months now,
  so they should understand that is how she is. I said work is different than personal
  life, and regardless if she is working with her friends, she needs to think about
  how she is perceived by others. She said it was not her problem, it was everyone
  else’s problem. I said that was not an acceptable reason. She got upset and said
  she did not want to work here anymore, that she did not feel comfortable here. I
  asked her to elaborate. Instead, she got up and ran out of the meeting. The meeting
  lasted 15 minutes. Thursday, March 17 – I scheduled a meeting with Tyller during
  her administrative hours to continue the discussion she cut short the day before.
  We went outside to get out of the CTL. She said she was the “CTL punching bag,”
  and that she felt everyone was against her. I told her that if she thought she was
  the CTL punching bag, she needed to get out of the way of the punches, and that
  is where I came in, to help her figure out how to do that. She kept coming back
  to how she needed specific examples. I said the specific examples I was giving her
  was of her tone and how multiple people had expressed concerns. It was not her language,
  but the tone. She said that was not good enough. I even modeled her tone from the
  labor meeting, and she laughed at me, saying that she did not believe me, that it
  was not true. She said that she did her job, and that she was good at it, so that
  was not the case. I said you are good at part of your job, but a big part of management
  is working with peers, and that needed work. She again said she could not fix a
  problem if she did not have specifics. The conversation was going nowhere, and she
  was clearly not receptive to even considering fault, or at the very least reflecting
  on it. Made decision to write up Tyller for her behavior due to her inability to
  even consider that her behavior was problematic was unacceptable, as well as her
  disrespect toward he labor supervisor. Wednesday, March 23 – Write Up Meeting -
  Lisa Ladanyi is present as third party at Tyller’s request. During this meeting
  Tyller is still unwilling to consider that her behavior was problematic. At the
  end of the meeting, Tyller pulled out a tape recorder and said she had taped the
  whole conversation. I asked why she did that, and she said “to get specifics that
  you were not giving me.” I asked if this was her idea or someone else’s, and she
  said it was her idea. Lisa said that while this may be true, it was unprofessional,
  and she should always ask permission. I agreed with Lisa. April 5 – Dismissal from
  Labor PositionMultiple problems arose after Tyller was written up for her behavior.
  She apparently did not take or understand our recommendations about communicating
  with her peers. Instead of talking to them about letting her know if her tone was
  problematic, she apparently went to them and tried to figure out whether or not
  they had reported her behavior. Not only did this happen with her peers, but professional
  staff, as well. This made for a very uncomfortable, if not hostile, working environment
  for professional staff and students and multiple complaints were reported.  Her
  behavior was also a direct violation of the CTL Student Contract “Teamwork and Self
  Respect” clause: “Treat everyone in a friendly and respectful manner. Cooperate
  with students, staff, faculty, employers, and all other guests visiting the CTL.
  You are also expected to treat each other, and the students you serve with respect,
  and be accountable for doing your very best work with consultations, workshops,
  and any other projects you are responsible for as part of your labor position.”
  Because of these continued problems, we decided to once again escalate these behavioral
  issues to Labor, and the decision was made by Labor to remove her from her labor
  position as she had already met her labor contract. Final NotesIt is disheartening
  to see a student like Tyller crumble under the pressure of conflict and criticism.
  I would not have urged her to take on a management position if I did not think that
  she had the wherewithal to rise to the challenge. While she was a great consultant,
  her primary work was management, which included mentoring and modeling professional
  behavior. It became clear in the second part of the Spring 2016 semester that she
  was not ready for the challenge of management and needed remediation. It is disappointing
  that she lacked the maturity to see this clearly. It is even more unacceptable in
  the way she responded to the feedback, as if she was being victimized and given
  no support. This response includes a Facebook post on Tyller’s Facebook page about
  Writing Resources and her labor supervisor posted around April 11. The post was
  considered by the reporting body to be “mildly threatening” in nature, and a screenshot
  was sent to administration.  If she was being mistreated by Writing Resources, then
  she would have never become a manager. She would have never been asked to take on
  the virtual writing consultation pilot project. She would have not been funded to
  participated in professional development opportunities. During our trip to Columbus,
  GA, for a writing center conference in February 2016, I stopped twice for her to
  see her mother in Chattanooga since it was on the way, both ways. Months earlier
  I gave her my old iPhone to keep when her cell phone died and she could not call
  her mom. This is hardly a lack of support for this student.   This behavior towards
  her peers, her labor supervisor, and the other professional staff is reflective
  of a lack of maturity and will not be tolerated in the professional world outside
  of Berea. Since the labor program is educational in nature, it is important that
  Tyller be educated that these behavioral issues and lack of respect for her peers
  and administrators has consequences. Conflict is difficult, and no one likes to
  be reprimanded especially if they think they have done nothing wrong. The ability
  to respectfully consider critical feedback will be skills that she will need going
  forward in all aspects of her life. '

- Anna has executed this job to the best of her ability. She has improved every semester
  and is graduating as one of the most impactful members of the Danforth Staff.
- With less focus on distractions, I have no doubt Kerry's performance would have
  been noticeably stronger.  As a result, his evaluation is restricted to being somewhat
  average, a mix of high points with some serious low points.
- Kyle has been a solid RA for the year.  I feel the position was not exactly what
  he expected, but he performed well in its capacity.  I feel he'll continue to do
  well in his next position.

- 'Kayla is spectacular. She is going to think through her actions regardless of the

  he will return as a Resident Advisor and help open up Bingham Hall.
- Michael has improved significantly in the basic labor requirements. he has improved
  his hours as well as the tass he is assigned. I will look for him to continue growing
  in this area.
- Overall, met all the job descriptions. Helped where she was needed and followed
  all the requirements as an RA.
- " "
- Doesn't really spend time with the residents unless asked to.
- " "
- Caitlin had a tough year and was challenged with balancing her personal life and
  position, often lacking in dedication, commitment, and involvement to build community
  with her and build her self in the role.
- If Sam applied to work in the department, I'd snag him up in a heartbeat.  He's
  a valuable member of any team in which he works, and his next labor department will
  be lucky to have him.
- " "
- Completes the requirements of the job.
- 'Kourtney had some great bulletin boards, door decs, addresses conflict and has
  really grown in this position. I look forward to seeing more growth and development
  in the next year. '

  residence life. He made it a personal point of pride to learn and soak up as much
  as he can and has done great this semester in executing his tasks.
- 'Epitomizes was it is to be an RA. He is already ready for a new challenge and will
  be a Program Specialist next year.  '

  forward to further assisting her in this area.
- Brandon has executed the job well with a high standard of attention to detail. i
  look forward for him to grow in a new role as Hall Coordinator next academic year.
- People can recognize him as an RA and come to him for problems. Outside of what
  he is asked to do, he does not seem to engage residents or community. He was encouraged
  to seek opportunities for more hours in his primary position—most of his labor hours
  came from structured meetings and times.
- Being a new staff member Kordell has risen to the occasion and has executed the
  basic requirements of his job well.
- Lazim, in his time of service, had a lot of potential to be a great Resident Advisor.  However,
  he made a poor decision that violated campus policies, and this led to his release.  Were
  it not for that one terrible decision, his evaluation score would be much higher,
  and his potential would have led to a brighter future in the department.
- Very solid semester and Rafael definitely fulfilled all of his labor requirements.
- In the beginning he needed a small amount of initiative, but by the second term
  he found his footing and did quite well overall.
- Gabby knows what is expected of her for the job and does her best to meet expectations.
  More balance and respect would improve this score.
- Overall, the first term I thought he needed to step it up a little. Then he did
  that and more the second term. Overall happy with his work here.
- There have been a few hiccups in Jennifer's performance when it comes to policy
  and procedures, but nothing glaring. For example, leaving the building during her
  duty night after the office hours. As soon as I informed her that she was to stay
  in the building, she took heed immediately and it was simply reflective of the fact
  that she was hired mid-year and training is not always as clear or thorough because
  it is abbreviated. She has been a positive and pleasant addition to the staff and
  I've appreciated her can-do attitude.
- In her final semester at this job, Taylor has mastered the Resident Advisor role
  and executes all of the basic requirements without flaw.
- Alexus as a graduating senior and a member of the Residence Life staff has done
  an amazing j0ob year after year. This year she has shown her maturity and senior
  status with great execution of all areas of the job.
- 'Amy''s awesome. She will be graduating in December to teach and she''ll be fabulous
  at it. '
- LeAnna has done extremly will in fulfilling the basic requirements of this job.
  I feel comfortable in saying she has mastered the ability of being a RA.
- Ben did a great job this year, and I feel he has great potential as he enters the
  world of work ahead.
- Overall Trinity is a good addition to the team and performs tasks well. She is always
  there for residents and is affirmed by her residents.
- Josiah ha seen consistent and solid all the way through. We always know what he
  is doing and has accomplished. It has been a pleasure having Josiah on staff.
- Vanessa minimally met the needs of the role.  She was not very active in the Student
  Life Department or her hall to build community, and to understand how it can impact
  her interpersonal skills.
- " "
- This year, Jessica was a perfect example of what an RA should be.  I've watched
  her grow in every category and blossom not only into a wonderful employee, but a
  wonderfully mature and apt young woman.

  next fall as a HC.  '

- I was exceptionally pleased with the work that Toni did in her hall this year. She
  initiated almost every program and was present in more ways than one.  Her work
  with the hall council was amazing as well.
- Overall, Brandon performed well as an RA this year.  In a few actions, though, it
  seemed his vision overextended beyond his own capacity to meet his goals.
- Outside of scheduling difficulties, Haley was a solid worker and had a positive
  impact on many of her residents.
- Ron has been a great asset to us as an RA these past two years.  He does what is
  expected, tries to help out additionally where he can, and has done well.  His next
  position, I have no doubt, will be met with equal success.
- Katie fulfilled her job description as a RA for Fairchild.  She has grown most in
  her team in leadership skills and her personal development.  Very proud of her growth
  and look forward to have her on staff next year!

- Sydney lacks motivation and interest.  She has challenges with her investment in
  her role and overall mission of students.
- Overall, Devin works hard to do what is expected.  Not a great deal more, but definitely
  shows an interest in doing his job well.

  with the team and also to see her personal development while leading others.
- 'Zakiyya is awesome. It would have been nice to see her seek leadership because
  she has the ability to do it. '
- " "
- Faith went above and beyond for her role.  She sells herself short but is a strong
  leader with her abilities to connect and lead others.  She is great with communication
  up and down and can take feedback.  Her peers trusted in her wisdom and guidance
  with confidence and say she will truly be missed! I would definitely work with her
  again!
- Fulfilled duties as RA and HC and took on HC of another staff as well.
- I never have complaints with Jeremy's work in this position.  He is a fantastic
  leader and performs above and beyond expectations.

  her for an award in excellence.

  a fabulous leader, a great team member and amazing individual. '

  being split between TAD and CS. Ishwar worked extra hours with me as a secondary,

  great eye for online systems, and builds features with the user in mind. He doesn't
  take shortcuts, and does his research before implementing. Ishwar worked very well
  with every member of the team, and ensured ideas were heard and consensus was reached
  in decision making. Ishwar was core to the team, and I am extremely appreciative
  of his extra efforts this term.

- Cayla provided guidance, support, and encouragement for the students.  She also
  provides assistance and support that made my work easier.  She is TERRIFIC at providing
  MLA citation and format guidance - I learned that I could turn over bibliography
  checks entirely to her without having to double-check her work.  The results of
  her assistance in this regard showed very clearly in the quality of the lists of
  works cited submitted by my students with their final papers.  She was also a helpful
  editor of the students' writing generally, asking good questions and providing helpful
  suggestions.  I would've certainly hired her again for my GSTR 110 class if she
  hadn't been hired by another faculty member!

- 'Aaron''s performance as a Teaching Assistant in the psychology continues to be
  outstanding.  This was a very busy semester with many challenges and considerable
  competition for Aaron''s attention. Keeping up with the demands of students in two
  distinctly different courses as well as his own demanding academic schedule was
  quite an accomplishment. '

- 'Will did everything that was asked of him this semester. He was present and participated
  in class and made connections with students. As stated before, I think the longer
  he is a TA/PL he will gain confidence to participate more in classroom sessions,
  provide more in-depth feedback on student writing, and have creative ideas to improve
  the research paper process for students. '

  great at his job, and it will be tough to find another T.A. as skilled and dedicated

  He demonstrated advanced interpersonal skills to really guide students in a supervisory

  an important component to help the students succeed in their group projects and

  a tremendous worker.
- 'This year was a challenge for Robert. Despite some hiccups, Robert managed himself
  and his work professionally. He was great about communicating his needs throughout
  the term, and ensuring I knew what challenges he was facing outside of labor, so
  I could adjust accordingly. Regarding Robert''s work, he does excellent work, researches
  solutions before inventing new ones, thinks about the big picture before implementing
  anything new, and ensuring changes that are made are done in a responsible, secure,
  and professional representation of our software engineering team. '
- 'Angela has served as an excellent TA for the CS department this year, working on
  two upper-division courses with a faculty member teaching them for the first time.
  Her energy and initiative are highly valued, and we are grateful for her effort
  and support of the CS program. '
- Guillermo impressed me this term. He really took the lead of the software engineering
  team, without being asked. He made decisions autonomously, and always let me know
  what was going on so I was never in the dark about those decisions. Guillermo did
  some great work in building process for our team, which we will be implementing
  more judiciously this summer and on. He managed his time well, balancing his coursework,
  personal life, and work life. Guillermo loves the work he is doing, and it shows
  in the quality of his end products. I'm happy to have him working for me again next
  year, and look forward to the leadership he brings to the team.

  in a more timely manner, though, and I am sure he can get there with enough time
  and guidance. '
- 'Craig has grown a lot in the two years I have known him. He brings a certain realism
  to everything he does. Some often see it as negativity, but Craig is simply managing
  his challenges and acknowledging that he has to deal with them directly. As a senior,
  Craig could have easily "checked out" and done the bare minimum, but he did not.
  Craig creat ed a lot of assignments which were used in the course, kept up with
  grading throughout the term and rarely got behind, despite his busy senior schedule,
  and was clear about what he needed to be successful. Craig was a valuable asset
  in class, helping a number of students solve their problems while I was busy elsewhere. '
- Andres was an exemplary TA.. I think that I was not able to give him work that would
  highlight his true abilities.

- Cera always fulfilled her job responsibilities.
- Although she will never receive all of the credit that she deserves, but Ashley
  is probably the most experienced and important Teaching Associate at Berea College.
  Very few students serve as Teaching Associates for more than three years. She knows
  what to do and then she does it in a professional manner.

- Bethany has been very successful at fulfilling all the requirements of the GSTR
  210 TA position.  She has met with students, attended class, participated in all

- Bridget met my expectations as a secondary labor student, and was great in helping
  students and supporting the lab and supporting grading. Thanks Bridget!
- Rebecca has a lot of small responsibilities for the CS program, and has had to manage
  her time wisely to fit it all into her secondary position. While a few things didn't
  get done, a number of other things happened instead. She started the planning process
  for a radio show, which was not originally planned, but she has owned the entire
  process and is working without any need for me to intervene. Rebecca has a lot of
  interests, and her biggest hurdle is focusing on those one or two which she can
  do well, instead of doing a lot of things poorly. Her ambition is admirable, and
  with a little focus, she will do great things.
- Kye has been developing a new system for the Chemical Inventory program, and has
  been developing the system as a secondary position. Typically, a 0-5 is unable to
  get much, if any, work done in designing and implementing a new system. Kye is the
  exception to that; he has designed the entire system, and began implementation.
  His groundwork will be used this summer to continue that project, and much of the
  design work is ready for the student who will be taking it over. That is an impressive
  feat, as handing off code is always a challenge. Thanks for your dedication this
  term to the project, and leaving it in a place where future work can be completed
  without a lot of bootstrapping.

- As a secondary labor student, Anais takes on probably more than her fair share of
  the "other duties as assigned" aspects of the job description. She has been cheerful
  and adaptable in doing so.

  tedious, due to her interest in art history.  Her attention to detail and systematic
  approach has meant that a tremendous amount of work was completed this term.  '

- 'Jerry has performed most of his clerical duties satisfactorily when given a specific
  agenda and deadline, with one notable exception. He has not been as effective with
  consistent progress on more long-term, less defined projects.  He and I will continue
  to work together in the future to divide the long-term projects into shorter, more
  measurable units with sub-deadlines and concrete, definable steps which will be
  more frequently assessed.  '

  always provide timely feedback and encouragement.  Nonetheless, she is well on her
  way to becoming a superb teaching assistant and i look forward to continuing our
  work together next year.

- 'I simply love Miss Cheryl. I am glad I have her as my supervisor because I personally
  and professionally got to learn a great deal of information every single day. She
  was able to offer me a real business experience more than I could have expected.
  Her expectations equal the high training and knowledge she offers and I am glad
  I work in AP department. She is a very responsible supervisor that cares about her

  left on my evaluation, and we had a good talk while he personally went over my evaluation
  with me. I am proud of the work I did this past spring and even more proud of all

- 'I felt as though a couple of these scores were wrong and discussed them with both
  Becky and Denessa. While the attendance section is correct. The area of teamwork
  is not true. If you ask anyone who knows me they would tell you that encouraging
  others is a strong point of mine. In fact, i spent much time encouraging my co workers
  even though it may have went unnoticed. However, i did feel as though teamwork in
  the office had decreased and eventually i became fed up with working on a team that
  was not willing to work with me. Further, i was always going the extra mile when
  i was at work and i feel as though that was not always seen. I do not agree with
  the fact that i do not manage time well or stay on task. In fact i am the person
  in the office that is always trying to find more work to do. '

- I do not agree with most of my supervisor's comments. I feel as if her expectations
  were unrealistic with the amount of time given for the project, and time should
  have been going towards finishing the book instead of having unnecessary meetings.
  I had a plan, lists of events, contact information, etc., and I feel like the team
  moved backwards to accommodate our newest addition and the changes that we were
  requested to make in the middle of the semester. I will admit that I did have some
  issues with time management because I was taking a very difficult course load as
  well as some extremely difficult personal issues. I do not feel as if I had adequate
  support in balancing this and work.

  day that I was scheduled for work and did not come in on time. If I left early it
  was only with the permission of my supervisor. I cannot say I agree with the other
  comments particularly, but they are at the discretion of my supervisor to make. '
- " "
- 'It is a rarity at my workplace to see Shan or receive instruction from him. Most
  of my work is done independently and of my own initiative. There is little interaction
  with him at all except for at labor meetings and minor general requests. Therefore
  I feel that his ability to evaluate my work is low. Shan does not see me working
  with other people, check my times, or give me feedback on my work. '
- " "
- " "

- I truly enjoyed this job. It was a great learning experience, as I learned how to
  balance work and school. It was also a good work environment. I felt very comfortable

  am not sure that supervisors should be told to grade most individuals with good
  standing within a number range that though supposedly positive, appears to be so
  low. '

  rather be in. The office teaches you so much that you can use in everyday life and

- 'I appreciate Mr. Buckner''s comments and feel the scores are more than appropriate.
  I felt as though I could have always done a little more, and done a little better,
  but given our short time (one semester) there was only so much that could be accomplished.
  I enjoyed gaining the new experience and learned quite a bit of new knowledge from
  Mr. Buckner. '
